{"author":"Sunan Abu Dawud","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4341,"arabicnumber":4341,"text":"Abu Umayyah ash-Sha'bani said:I asked AbuTha'labah al-Khushani: What is your opinion about the verse \"Care for yourselves\". He said: I swear by Allah, I asked the one who was well informed about it; I asked the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) about it. He said: No, enjoin one another to do what is good and forbid one another to do what is evil. But when you see niggardliness being obeyed, passion being followed, worldly interests being preferred, everyone being charmed with his opinion, then care for yourself, and leave alone what people in general are doing; for ahead of you are days which will require endurance, in which showing endurance will be like grasping live coals. The one who acts rightly during that period will have the reward of fifty men who act as he does. Another version has: He said (The hearers asked:) Messenger of Allah, the reward of fifty of them? He replied: The reward of fifty of you","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":39,"hadith":51}}}
