{"author":"Sunan Abu Dawud","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4084,"arabicnumber":4084,"text":"Narrated AbuJurayy Jabir ibn Salim al-Hujaymi: I saw a man whose opinion was accepted by the people, and whatever he said they submitted to it. I asked: Who is he? They said: This is the Messenger of Allah (ï·º). I said: On you be peace, Messenger of Allah, twice. He said: Do not say \"On you be peace,\" for \"On you be peace\" is a greeting for the dead, but say \"Peace be upon you\". I asked: You are the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon you)? He said: I am the Messenger of Allah Whom you call when a calamity befalls you and He removes it; when you suffer from drought and you call Him, He grows food for you; and when you are in a desolate land or in a desert and your she-camel strays and you call Him, He returns it to you. I said: Give me some advice. He said: Do not abuse anyone. He said that he did not abuse a freeman, or a slave, or a camel or a sheep thenceforth. He said: Do not look down upon any good work, and when you speak to your brother, show him a cheerful face. This is a good work. Have your lower garment halfway down your shin; if you cannot do it, have it up to the ankles. Beware of trailing the lower garment, for it is conceit and Allah does not like conceit. And if a man abuses and shames you for something which he finds in you, then do not shame him for something which you find in him; he will bear the evil consequences for it","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":65}}}
