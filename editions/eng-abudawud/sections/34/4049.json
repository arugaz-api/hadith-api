Their preacher was a man of Azd called AbuRayhanah, who was a companion of the Prophet (ﷺ). Abul Husayn said:my companion went to the mosque before me. I went there after him and sat beside him.

Abu Dawud said: The solitary point in this tradition (not supported by other traditions) is the report about the signet-ring",
