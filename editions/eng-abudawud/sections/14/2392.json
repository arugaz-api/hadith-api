    "text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah: (A man broke his fast intentionally) during Ramadan. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded him to emancipate a slave, or fast for two months, or feed sixty poor men. He said: I cannot provide. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Sit down. Thereafter a huge basket of dates ('araq) was brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: Take this and give it as sadaqah (alms). He said: Messenger of Allah, there is no poorer than I. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) thereupon laughed so that his canine teeth became visible and said: Eat it yourself. Abu Dawud said: Ibn Juraij narrated it from al-Zuhri in the wordings of the narrator Malik that a man broke his fast. This version says: You should either free a slave, or fast for two months, or provide food for sixty poor men",
