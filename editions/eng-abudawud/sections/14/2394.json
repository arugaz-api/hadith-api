He said: I had sexual intercourse with my wife. He said: Give sadaqah (alms). He said: I swear by Allah, I possess nothing with me, and I cannot do this. He said: Sit down. He sat down. While he was waiting, a man came forward driving his donkey loaded with food. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Where is the man who was burnt just now ? Thereupon the man stood up. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Give it as sadaqah (alms). He asked: Messenger of Allah, to others than us ? By Allah. we are hungry, we have nothing (to eat). He said: Eat it yourselves",
