But it occurred to him that he should take the camels back from them. He sent his son to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said to him: Go to the Prophet (ﷺ) and tell him: My father extends his greetings to you. He asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam, and they embraced Islam. He divided the camels among them. But it occurred to him then that he should withdraw his camels from them. Is he more entitled to them or we? If he says: Yes or no, then tell him: My father is an old man, and he is the chief of the people living at the water. He has requested you to make me chief after him. He came to him and said: My father has extended his greetings to you. He replied: On you and you father be peace. He said: My father asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and their belief in Islam is good. Then it occurred to him that he should take his camels back from them. Is he more entitled to them or are they? He said: If he likes to give them the camels, he may give them; and if he likes to take them back, he is more entitled to them than his people. If they embraced Islam, then for them is their Islam. If they do not embrace Islam, they will be fought against in the cause of Islam. He said: My father is an old man; he is the chief of the people living at the spring. He has asked you to appoint me chief after him. He replied: The office of a chief is necessary, for people must have chiefs, but the chiefs will go to Hell",

The narrator Ibn al-Sarh said: (He appointed) Ibn al-Utbiyyah to collect the sadaqah. When he returned he said: This is for you and this was given to me as present. So the Prophet (ﷺ) stood on the pulpit, and after praising and extolling Allah he said: What is the matter with a collector of sadaqah. We send him (to collect sadaqah), and when he return he says: This is for you and this is a present which was given to me. Why did he not sit in his father's or mother's house and see whether it would be given to him or not ? Whoever takes any of it will inevitably bring it on the Day of Resurrection, be it a camel which rumbles, an ox which bellows, or sheep which-bleats. Then raising his arms so that we could see where the hair grow under his armpits, he said: O Allah, have I given full information ? O Allah, have I given full information ?",

The believers considered him to be just, according to the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ): Allah has placed truth upon Umar's tongue and heart.

        "text": "Narrated Malik b. Aws b. Al-Hadathan: 'Umar sent for me when the day rose high. I found him sitting on a couch without cover. When I entered upon him, he said: Malik, some people of you tribe gradually came here, and I have ordered to give them something, so distribute it among them. I said: If you assigned this (work) to some other person, (it would be better). He said: Take it. Then Yarfa' came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, will you permit 'Uthman b. 'Affan, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, al-Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and Sa'd b, Abi Waqqas (to enter) ? He said: Yes. So he permitted them and they entered. Yarfa' again came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, would you permit al-'Abbas and 'Ali ? He said: Yes. He then permitted them and they entered. Al-'Abbas said: Commander of Faithful, decide between me and this, referring to 'Ali. Some of them said: Yes, Commander of the Faithful, decide between them and give them comfort. Malik b. Aws said: It occurred to me that both of them brought the other people for this. 'Umar said: Show patience (do not make haste). He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then said: Allah has appointed for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) a special portion (in the booty) which he did not do for anyone. Allah, Most High, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His apostles over any He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things\". Allah bestowed (the property of) Banu al-Nadir on His Apostle. I swear by Allah, he did not reserve it for himself, nor did he take it over and above you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to his share for his maintenance annually, or used to take his contribution and give his family their annual contribution (from this property), then take what remained and deal with it as he did with Allah's property. He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, Abu Bakr said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then you and this ('Ali) came to Abu Bakr, demanding a share from the inheritance of your cousin, and this ('Ali) demanding the share of his wife from (the property of her) father. Abu Bakr then said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah. Allah knows that he (Abu Bakr) was true, faithful, rightly-guided, and the follower of Triuth. Abu Bakr then administered it (property of the Prophet). When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr. So I administered whatever Allah wished. Then you and this ('Ali) came. Both of you are at one, and your matter is the same. So they asked me for it (property), and I said: If you wish I give it to you on condition that you are bound by the covenant of Allah, meaning that you will administer it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to administer. So you took it from me on that condition. Then again you have come to me so that I decide between you other than that. I swear by Allah, I shall not decide between you other than that till the Last Hour comes. If you helpless, return it to me. Abu Dawud said: They asked him for making it half between them, and not that they were ignorant of the fact the Prophet (ﷺ) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They were also seeking the truth. 'Umar then said: I do not apply the name of division to it ; It leave it on its former condition",

We are not to be inherited. They said: Yes, indeed. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to spend from his property on his family, and give the residue as sadaqah (alms).

Messenger of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to pay our dower. So appoint us collector of sadaqah (zakat), Messenger of Allah, and we shall give you what the other collectors give you, and we shall have the benefit accruing from it. Ali came to us while we were in this condition. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: No, I swear by Allah, he will not appoint any of you collector of sadaqah (zakat). Rabi'ah said to him: This is your condition; you have gained your relationship with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) by marriage, but we did not grudge you that. Ali then put his cloak on the earth and lay on it. He then said: I am the father of Hasan, the chief. I swear by Allah, I shall not leave this place until your sons come with a reply (to the question) for which you have sent them to the Prophet (ﷺ). AbdulMuttalib said: So I and al-Fadl went towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). We found that the noon prayer in congregation had already started. So we prayed along with the people. I and al-Fadl then hastened towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (ﷺ). He was (staying) with Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, that day. We stood until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came. He caught my ear and the ear of al-Fadl. He then said: Reveal what you conceal in your hearts. He then entered and permitted me and al-Fadl (to enter). So we entered and for a little while we asked each other to talk. I then talked to him, or al-Fadl talked to him (the narrator, Abdullah was not sure). He said: He spoke to him concerning the matter about which our fathers ordered us to ask him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent for a moment and raised his eyes towards the ceiling of the room. He took so long that we thought he would not give any reply to us. Meanwhile we saw that Zaynab was signalling to us with her hand from behind the veil, asking us not to be in a hurry, and that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was (thinking) about our matter. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then lowered his head and said to us: This sadaqah (zakat) is a dirt of the people. It is legal neither for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. Call Nawfal ibn al-Harith to me. So Nawfal ibn al-Harith was called to him. He said: Nawfal, marry AbdulMuttalib (to your daughter). So Nawfal married me (to his daughter). The Prophet (ﷺ) then said: Call Mahmiyyah ibn Jaz'i to me. He was a man of Banu Zubayd, whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had appointed collector of the fifths. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Mahmiyyah: Marry al-Fadl (to your daughter). So he married him to her. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Stand up and pay the dower from the fifth so-and-so on their behalf. Abdullah ibn al-Harith did not name it (i.e. the amount of the dower)",

When I intended to cohabit with Fathimah daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I made arrangement with a man who was a goldsmith belonging to Banu Qainuqa’ to go with me so that we may bring grass. I intended to sell it to the goldsmith there by seeking help in my wedding feast. While I was collecting for my old Camels saddles, baskets and ropes both of she Camels were seated in a corner of the apartment of a man of the Ansar. When I collected what I collected (i.e., equipment) I turned (towards them). I suddenly found that the humps of she Camels were cut off and their hips were pierced and their lives were taken out. I could not control my eyes (to weep) when I saw that scene. I said “Who has done this?” They (the people) replied “Hamzah bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib”. He is among the drunkards of the Ansar in this house. A singing girl is singing for him and his Companions. While singing she said “Oh Hamza, rise to these plumpy old she Camels. So he jumped to the sword and cut off their humps, pierced their hips and took out their livers.” ‘Ali said “I went till I entered upon the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) while Zaid bin Harithah was with him.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) realized what I had met with. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) aid “What is the matter with you?” I said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), I never saw the thing that happened with me today. Hamzah wronged my she Camels, he cut off their humps, pierced their hips. Lo! He is in a house with drunkards. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asked for his cloak. It was brought to him. He then went out, I and Zaid bin Harithah followed him until we reached the house where Hamzah was. He asked permission ( to entre). He was permitted. He found drunkards there. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) began to rebuke him (Hamzah) for his action. Hamzah was intoxicated and his eyes were reddish. Hamzah looked at the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). He then raised his eyes and looked at his knees, he then raised his eyes and looked at his navel and he then raised his eyes and looked at his face. Hamzah then said “Are you but the salves of my father? Then the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) knew that he was intoxicated. So the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) moved backward. He then went out and we also went out with him.”",

The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “the orphans of the people who were killed in the battle of Badr came before you (and they asked for the captives). But I tell you something better than that. You should utter “Allaah is Most Great” after each prayer thirty three times, “Glory be to Allaah” thirty three times, “Praise be to Allaah” thirty three times and “there is no god but Allaah alone, He has no associate, the Kingdom belongs to Him and praise is due to Him and He has power over all things.” The narrator ‘Ayyash said “They were daughters of Uncle of the Prophet (ﷺ).”",

He said “She pulled the grinding stone with her hand so much that it affected her hand, she carried water in a water bag so much so that it affected the upper portion of her chest, she swept the house so much so that her clothes became dirty. The Prophet (ﷺ) acquired some slaves”. So I said “Would that you go to your father and ask him for a slave. She then came to him and found some people with him talking to him. She therefore returned. Next day she came again. He asked (her), what was your need? But she kept silence. So I said, I inform you, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). She pulled grinding stone so much that it affected her hand, she carried water bag so much so that it affected the upper portion of her chest. When the slaves were brought to you I asked her to come to you and to ask you for a slave to save her from the exertion she is suffering.” He said “Fear Allaah, Fathimah and perform the duty of your Lord and do the work of your family.” When you go to bed say “Glory be to Allaah” thirty three times, “Praise be to Allaah” thirty three times, “Allaah is Most Great” thirty four times. This is hundred times. That will be better for you than a servant. She said “I am pleased with Allaah, Most High and with his Apostle (ﷺ).”",

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Had I appointed blood-money for a polytheist, I should have appointed it for your brother. But I shall give you compensation for him. So the Prophet (ﷺ) wrote (a document) for him that he should be given a hundred camels which were to be acquired from the fifth taken from the polytheists of Banu Dhuhl. So he took a part of them, for Banu Dhuhl embraced Islam. He then asked AbuBakr for them later on, and brought to him the document of the Prophet (ﷺ). So AbuBakr wrote for him that he should be given one thousand two hundred sa's from the sadaqah of al-Yamamah; four thousand (sa's) of wheat, four thousand (sa's) of barley, and four thousand (sa's) of dates. The text of the document written by the Prophet (ﷺ) for Mujja'ah was as follows: \"In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. This document is from Muhammad, the Prophet, to Mujja'ah ibn Mirarah of Banu Sulma. I have given him one hundred camels from the first fifth acquired from the polytheist of Banu Dhuhl as a compensation for his brother",

        "text": "Narrated A man from the companions of the Prophet: AbdurRahman ibn Ka'b ibn Malik reported on the authority of a man from among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ): The infidels of the Quraysh wrote (a letter) to Ibn Ubayy and to those who worshipped idols from al-Aws and al-Khazraj, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at that time at Medina before the battle of Badr. (They wrote): You gave protection to our companion. We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women. When this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When this news reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (ﷺ), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh. The infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (ﷺ), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty. They sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story. When the next day came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them. He told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day. Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it. He turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees were exclusively reserved for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special portion. He (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no expedition with either camel corps or cavalry.\" He said: \"Without fighting.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) gave most of it to the emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of it between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did not divide it among any of the helpers except those two. The rest of it survived as the sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) which is in the hands of the descendants of Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her)",

If they did (so), there would be no protection for them and no treaty (with Muslims). They carried away a purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab who was killed before (the battle of) Khaybar. He took away the ornaments of Banu an-Nadir when they were expelled. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Sa'yah: Where is the purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab? He replied: The contents of this purse were spent on battles and other expenses. (Later on) they found the purse. So he killed Ibn AbulHuqayq, captured their women and children, and intended to deport them. They said: Muhammad, leave us to work on this land; we shall have half (of the produce) as you wish, and you will have half.

They gathered and the Prophet (ﷺ) led them in prayer, stood up and said: Does any of you, while reclining on his couch, imagine that Allah has prohibited only that which is to be found in this Qur'an? By Allah, I have preached, commanded and prohibited various matters as numerous as that which is found in the Qur'an, or more numerous.

        "text": "Narrated Abdullah al-Hawzani: I met Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Aleppo, and said: Bilal, tell me, what was the financial position of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him. A man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants. When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian. I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me. He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month? I replied: The time is near. He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission. I said: Messenger of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (ﷺ) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way. All of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground? I replied: Yes. He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting there. I greeted him. He asked: What benefit did you have from your property? I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Nothing remains now. He asked: Did anything remain (from that property)? I said: Yes. He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)? I said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed the night in the mosque. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)? I replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Messenger of Allah. He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me",

He found the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) had returned and he did not conquer (Ta'if). On that day Sakhr made a covenant with Allah and had His protection that he would not depart from that fortress until they (the inhabitants) surrendered to the command of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He did not leave them until they had surrendered to the command of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Sakhr then wrote to him: To proceed: Thaqif have surrendered to your command, Messenger of Allah, and I am on my way to them. They have horses with them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered prayers to be offered in congregation. He then prayed for Ahmas ten times: O Allah, send blessings the horses and the men of Ahmas. The people came and Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said to him: Prophet of Allah, Sakhr took my paternal aunt while she embraced Islam like other Muslims. He called him and said: Sakhr, when people embrace Islam, they have security of their blood and property. Give back to Mughirah his paternal aunt. So he returned his aunt to him and asked the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ): What about Banu Sulaym who have run away for (fear of) Islam and left that water? He said: Prophet of Allah, allow me and my people to settle there. He said: Yes. So he allowed him to settle there. Banu Sulaym then embraced Islam, and they came to Sakhr. They asked him to return their water to them. But he refused. So they came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Prophet of Allah, we embraced Islam and came to Sakhr so that he might return our water to us. But he has refused. He (the Prophet) then came to him and said: When people embrace Islam, they secure their properties and blood. Return to the people their water. He said: Yes, Prophet of Allah. I saw that the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was reddening at that moment, being ashamed of taking back from him the slave-girl and the water",
