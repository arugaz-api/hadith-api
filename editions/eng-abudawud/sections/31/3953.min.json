Thereupon his wife said: I swear by Allah, now you will be sold (as a repayment) for his loan. So I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah! I am a woman of Banu Kharijah Qays ibn Aylan. My uncle had brought me to Medina in pre-Islamic days. He sold me to al-Hubab ibn Amr, brother of AbulYusr ibn Amr. I bore AbdurRahman ibn al-Hubab to him. His wife said: I swear by Allah, you will be sold for his loan. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who is the guardian of al-Hubab? He was told: His brother, AbulYusr ibn Amr. He then sent for him and said: Set her free; when you hear that some slaves have been brought to me, came to me, and I shall compensate you for her. She said: They set me free, and when some slaves were brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he gave them a slave in compensation for me","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":28}}}
