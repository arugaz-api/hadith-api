    "text": "AbuUmamah at-Taymi said:I was a man who used to give (riding-beasts) on hire for this purpose (for travelling during the pilgrimage) and the people would tell (me): Your hajj is not valid. So I met Ibn Umar and told him: AbuAbdurRahman, I am a man who gives (riding-beast) on hire for this purpose (i.e. for hajj), and the people tell me: Your hajj is not valid. Ibn Umar replied: Do you not put on ihram (the pilgrim dress), call the talbiyah (labbayk), circumambulate the Ka'bah, return from Arafat and lapidate jamrahs? I said: Why not? Then he said: Your hajj is valid. a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him the same question you have asked me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silence and did not answer him till this verse came down: \"It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent for him and recited this verse to him and said: Your hajj is valid",
