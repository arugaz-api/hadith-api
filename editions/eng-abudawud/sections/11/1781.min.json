The Apostel of Allah (SWAS) said those who have brought the sacrificial animals with them should raise their voices in talbiyah for Hajj along with an ‘Umrah and they should not put off their Ihram till they do so after performing them both. I came to Makkah while I was menstruating and I did not go round the House (the Ka’bah) or run between al-Safa and al-Marwah. I complained about this to the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) he said: Undo your hair, comb it and raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj and let `Umrah go. She said I did so. When we performed Hajj, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) sent me along with `Abd al-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to al-Ta’nim and I performed `Umrah. He said, this is `Umrah in place of the one you had missed. She said those who had raised their voices in talbiyah for `Umrah put off Ihram after circumambulating the House (the Ka’bah) and after running between al-Safa and al-Marwa. Then they performed another circumambulation for their Hajj after they returned from Mina but those who combined Hajj and `Umrah performed only one circumambulation","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (1556) Sahih Muslim (1211)"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":61}}}
