Al Miswar said A pilgrim in the sacred state(wearing ihram) cannot wash his head. ‘Abd Allah bin Abbas then sent him (‘Abd Allah bin Hunain) to Abu Ayyub Al Ansari. He found him taking a bath between two woods erected at the edge of the well and he was hiding himself with a cloth (curtain). He (the narrator) said I saluted him. He asked Who is this? I said I am ‘Abd Allah bin Hunain. ‘Abd Allah bin Abbas has sent me to you asking you how the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) used to wash his head while he was wearing ihram.
