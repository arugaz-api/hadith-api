    "text": "Narrated Sulayman ibn AbuAbdullah: Sulayman ibn AbuAbdullah said: I saw Sa'd ibn AbuWaqqas seized a man hunting in the sacred territory of Medina which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had declared to be sacred. He took away his clothes from him. His patrons came to him and spoke to him about it, but he replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) declared this territory to be sacred, saying: If anyone catches someone hunting in it he should take away from him his clothes. So I shall not return to you a provision which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has given me, but if you wish I shall pay you its price",
