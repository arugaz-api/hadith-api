    "text": "Bakr bin ‘Abd Allah said “A man said to Ibn ‘Abbas “What about the people of this House? They supply Nabidh to the public while their cousins provide milk, honey and mush (sawiq). Is this due to their niggardliness or need? Ibn ‘Abbas replied “This is due neither to our niggardliness nor to our need, but the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) (once) entered upon us on his riding beast and ‘Usamah bin Zaid was sitting behind him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) called for drink. Nabidh was brought to him and he drank from it and gave its left over to Usamah bin Zaid who drank from it. The Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) then said “You have done a good and handsome deed and do it in a similar way . It is due to this we are doing so, we do not want to change what the Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ)had said",
