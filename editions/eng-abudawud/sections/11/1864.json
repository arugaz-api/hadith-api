    "text": "Maymun ibn Mahran said:I came out to perform umrah in the year when the people of Syria besieged Ibn az-Zubayr at Mecca. Some people of my tribe sent sacrificial animals with me as an offering. When we reached the people of Syria, they stopped us from entering the sacred territory. I, therefore, sacrificed the animals at the same spot. I then took off ihram and returned. Next year I came out to make an atonement for my umrah. I came to Ibn Abbas and asked him (about it). He said: Bring a new sacrificial animal, for the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) ordered his companions to bring fresh sacrificial animals for the umrah of atonement in lieu of the animals they had sacrificed in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah",
