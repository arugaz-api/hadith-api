When she reached Sarif, she menstruated. When we came to (Makkah) we circumambulated the Ka’bah and ran between al Safa’ and al Marwah. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) then commanded us that those who had not brought sacrificial animals withthem should put off their ihram (after ‘Umrah). We asked “Which acts are lawful(and which not)? He replied All acts are lawful (that are permissible usually). We had therefore intercourse with our wives, used perfumes, put on our clothes. There remained only four days to perform Hajj at ‘Arafah. We then raised our voice in talbiyah (wearing Ihram for Hajj) on the eighth of Dhu al Hijjah. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) entered upon A’ishah and found her weeping. He said What is the matter with you? My problem is that I have menstruated, while the people have put on their ihram but I have not done so, nor did I go round the House(the Ka’bah). Now the people are proceeding for Hajj. He said This is a thing destined by Allah to the daughters of Adam. Take a bath, then raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj(i.e, wear ihram for Hajj). She took a abtah and performed all the rites of the Hajj(lit. she stayed at all those places where the pilgrims stay). When she was purified, she circumambulated the House (the Ka’bah), and ran between al Safa’ and al Marwah. He (the Prophet) said “Now you have performed both your Hajj and your ‘Umrah. She said Messenger of Allah, I have some misgiving in my mind that I did not go round the Ka’bah when I performed Hajj (in the beginning). He said ‘Abd al Rahman (her brother), take her and have her perform ‘Umrah from Al Tan’im. This happened on the night of Al Hasbah(i.e., the fourteenth of Dhu Al Hijjah)",
