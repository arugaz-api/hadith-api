When we came to Makkah four days of Dhu al Hijjah had already passed. We the circumambulated (the Ka’bah) and ran between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah . The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then commanded us to put off ihram. He said if I had not brought the sacrificial animals, I would have taken off Ihram. Suraqah bin Malik then stood up and said Apostle of Allaah , what do you think, have you provided this facility to us for this year alone or forever? The Apostle of Allaah said No, this forever and forever. Al Awza’l said I heard Ata bin Abi Rabah narrating this tradition, but I did not memorize it till I met Ibn Juraij who confirmed it for me","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (7367) Sahih Muslim (1216)"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":67}}}
