Salim said: (He gave me) his slave as a gift. My mother 'Umrah daughter of Rawahah said: Go to the Messenger of Allah and call him as witness. He then came to the Prophet (ï·º) and mentioned it to him. He said him: I have given my son al-Nu'man a gift, and 'Umrah has asked me to call you as witness to it. He asked him: Have you children other than him? He said: I replied: Yes. He again asked: Have you given the rest of them the same as you have given al-Nu'man ? He said: No. Some of these narrators said in their version (that the Prophet said:) This in injustice. The others said in their version (that the Prophet said:) This is under force. So call some other person than me as witness to it. Mughirah said in his version: (The Prophet asked): Are you not pleased with the fact that all of them may be equal in virtue and grace ? He replied: Yes. He said: Then call some other person than me as witness to it. Mujahid mentioned in his version: They have right to you that you should do justice to them, as you have right to them that they should do good to you. Abu Dawud said: In the version of al-Zuhri some (narrators) said: (Have you given) to all your sons ? and some (narrators) said: Your children. Ibn Abi Khalid narrated from al-Sha'bi in his version: Have your sons other than him ? Abu al-Duha narrated on the authority of al-Nu'man b. Bashir: Have you children other than him ?","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":127}}}
