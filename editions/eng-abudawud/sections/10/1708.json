This version adds; if its seeker comes, and recognizes its container and its number, then give it to him. Hammad also narrated it from `Ubaid Allah bin `Umar from `Amr bin Shu’aib, from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (SWAS) something similar. Abu Dawud said :This addition made by Hammad bin Salamah bin Kuhail, Yahya bin Sa’id, `Ubaid Allah bin `Umar and Rabi’ah; “if its owner comes and recognizes its container, and its string,” is not guarded.
