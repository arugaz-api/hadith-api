This version adds:They have their stomachs: They can go down to water and eat trees. He did not say about the stray sheep: take it. About a find he said : Make it known for a year; if it’s owner comes, (give it to him), otherwise use it yourself. This version has not the word : “ spend it”. Abu Dawud said : This tradition has been narrated by al-Thawri, Sulaiman bin Bilal, and Hammad bin Salamah on the authority of Rabi ‘ ah in a similar manner. They did not mention the word “take it”",
