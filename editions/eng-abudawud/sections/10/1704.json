    "text": "Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhani said :A man asked the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) about a find. He said: Make the matter known for a year, then note its string and its container and then use it for your purpose. Then if its owner comes, give it to him. He asked : Messenger of Allah, what about a stray sheep? He replied: Take it; that is for you, or for your brother, or for the wolf. He again asked: Messenger of Allah, What about stray camels? The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) became angry so much so that his cheeks became red or ( the narrator is doubtful) his face became red. He replied: What have you to do with them? They have with them their feet and their stomachs (for drink) till their master comes to him",
