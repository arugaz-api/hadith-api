    "text": "Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah: I witnessed sacrificing along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the place of prayer. When he finished his sermon, he descended from his pulpit, and a ram was brought to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slaughtered it with his hand, and said: In the name of Allah, Allah, is Most Great. This is from me and from those who did not sacrifice from my community",
