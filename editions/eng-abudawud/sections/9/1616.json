    "text": "Abu sa’id al-khudri said :When the Messenger of Allah(May peace be upon him) lived among us, we use to bring forth zakat, on closing the fast of Ramadan one sa’ of grain or of cheese, or of barley, or of dried dates, or of raisens, payable by every young and old freeman and slave. We continued to pay this till mu-awayah came to perform Haj or Umra and he spoke to the people on the pulpit. What he said to the people was : I think that Mudds of the wheat of syrria is equivalent to one sa’ of dried dates. So the people adopted it. Abu sa’id said : But I continued to pay one sa’ of wheat as long as I lived on. Abu Dawud said : this tradition has also been transmitted by Abu sa’id through a different chain of narrators to the same effect. A man has narrated in this version from Ibn-Ulayyah one sa’ of wheat. But this version is not guarded",
