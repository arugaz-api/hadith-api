    "text": "Amr bin Shu'aib, on his father's authority, said that his grandfather reported:Hilal, a man from the tribe of Banu Mat'an brought a tenth of honey which he possessed in beehives to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He asked him (the apostle of Allah) to give the wood known as Salabah as a protected (or restricted) land. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave him that wood as a protected land. When Umar ibn al-Khattab succeeded, Sufyan ibn Wahb wrote to Umar asking him about this wood. Umar ibn al-Khattab wrote to him: If he (Hilal) pays you the tithe on honey what he used to pay to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), leave the protected land of Salabah in his possession; otherwise those bees are like those of any wood; anyone can take the honey as he likes",
