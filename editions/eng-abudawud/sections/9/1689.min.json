{"author":"Sunan Abu Dawud","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1689,"arabicnumber":1689,"text":"Anas said When the verse “You will never attain righteousness until you give freely of what you love\" came down, Abu Talhah said Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I think our Lord asks us for our property. I call you as witness that I dedicate my land at Ariha ‘to Him’. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him Divide it among your nearest relatives. So he divided it among Hassan bin Thabit and Ubayy bin Ka’b. Abu Dawud said I have been gold by an Ansari Muhammad bin ‘Abdallah that the name of Abu Talhah is Zaid bin Sahal bin al-Aswad bin Haram bin ‘Amar bin Zaid bin Manat bin ‘Adi bin ‘Amr bin Malik bin al-Najjar; and Hassan bin Tabit is son of al-Mundhir in al-Haram. Thus both of them (Abu Talhah and Hassan) have their common link in Haram who is the third great grandfather. Ubbay bin Ka’b is son of Qais bin ‘Atik bin Zaid bin Mu’awiyah bin ‘Amr bin Malik bin al-Najjar. Thus the common tie between Hassan, Abu Talhah and Ubbay is ‘Amr (bin Malik). The Ansari said between Ubbay and Abi Talhah there are six great grandfathers","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Maqtu"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim (998)"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":134}}}
