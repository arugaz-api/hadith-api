He said : Do you take the oath of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him), and we shortly took the oath of allegiance. We said: we have already taken the oath of allegiance to you. He repeated the same words three times. We then stretched our hands and took the oath of allegiance to him. A man (or us) said : We took the oath of allegiance to you; now on what should we take the oath of allegiance, Messenger of Allah ? He replied: That you should worship Allah, do not associate anything with Him, offer five times prayer, listen and obey. He uttered a word quietly : And do not beg from the people.
