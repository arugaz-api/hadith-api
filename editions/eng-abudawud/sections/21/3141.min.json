When they (the people) differed among themselves, Allah cast slumber over them until every one of them had put his chin on his chest.

So they stood round the Prophet (ﷺ) and washed him while he had his shirt on him. They poured water on his shirt, and rubbed him with his shirt and not with their hands. Aisha used to say: If I had known beforehand about my affair what I found out later, none would have washed him except his wives","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":53}}}
