    "text": "Narrated Saburah ibn Ma'bad al-Juhani: The Prophet (ï·º) alighted at a place where a mosque has been built under a large tree. He tarried there for three days, and then proceeded to Tabuk. Juhaynah met him on a wide plain. He asked them: who are the people of Dhul-Marwah? They replied: Banu Rifa'ah of Juhaynah. He said: I have given this (land) to Banu Rifa'ah as a fief. Therefore, they divided it. Some of them sold (their share) and others retained and worked on it. (Sub-narrator Ibn Wahab said: I then asked AbdulAziz about this tradition. He narrated a part of it to me and did not narrate it in full)",
