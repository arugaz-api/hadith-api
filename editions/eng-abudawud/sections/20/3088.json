    "text": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As: When we went out along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to at-Ta'if we passed a grave. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: This is the grave of AbuRighal. He was in this sacred mosque (sanctuary) protecting himself (from punishment). When he came out, he suffered the same punishment which his people suffered at this place, and he was buried in it. The sign of it is that a golden bough was buried with him. If you dig it out, you will find it with him. The people hastened to it and took out the bough",
