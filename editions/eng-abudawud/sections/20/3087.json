It then continued to take out dinars one by one until it took out seventeen dinars. It then took out a red purse containing a dinar. There were thus eighteen dinars. He took them to the Prophet (ﷺ), informed him and said to him: Take its sadaqah. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: Did you extend your hand toward the hole? He replied: No. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: May Allah bless you in it",
