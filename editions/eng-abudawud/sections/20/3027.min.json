If you accept something, we shall accept it, and if you disapprove of something, we shall disapprove of it. I said: Yes. So I proceeded until I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I liked his motive and my people embraced Islam. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote the document for Umayr Dhu Marran. He also sent Malik ibn Murarah ar-Rahawi to all the (people of) Yemen. So Akk Dhu Khaywan embraced Islam. Akk was told: Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and obtain his protection for your town and property. He therefore came (to him) and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote a document for him: \"In the name of Allah, Most Beneficent, Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Akk Dhu Khaywan. If he is true his land, property and slave, he has the security and the protection of Allah, and Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.
