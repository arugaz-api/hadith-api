Had you fought with us, you would have known us. You have never met people like us.” Allah Most High revealed about this the following verse “Say to those who reject faith, soon will ye be vanished... one army was fighting in the cause of Allaah, the other resisting Allaah.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":74}}}
