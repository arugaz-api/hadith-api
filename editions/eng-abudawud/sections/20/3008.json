    "text": "‘Abd Allah bin ‘Umar reported that ‘Umar said “When Khaibar was conquered, the Jews asked the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) to confirm that they would do all the cultivation and have half the produce. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “I shall confirm you on that condition as long as we wish. So they were confirmed on that (condition). The dates from half the produce of Khaibar were divided into a number of portions. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) would take the fifth. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) used to contribute from the fifth one hundred wasqs of dates and twenty wasqs of wheat to each of his wives. When ‘Umar intended to expel the Jews from Khaibar he sent a message to the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) and said to them “If any of you wishes that I divide the palm trees for her by their assessment that amounts one hundred wasqs (of dates) and to her belongs their root, their land and their water and (likewise) twenty wasqs from the produce of the cultivated land by assessment, I shall (do that). And if any of you wishes that we take out her portion from the fifth, we shall do (that)",
