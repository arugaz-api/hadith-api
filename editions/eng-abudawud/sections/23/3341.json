    "text": "Narrated Samurah: The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) addressed us and said: Is here any one of such and such tribe present? But no one replied. He again asked: Is here any one of such and such tribe present? But no one replied. He again asked: Is here any one of such and such tribe? Then a man stood and said: I am (here), Messenger of Allah. He said: What prevented you from replying the first two times? I wish to tell you something good. Your companion has been detained (from entering Paradise) on account of his debt. Then I saw him that he paid off all his debt on his behalf and there remained no one to demand from him anything. Abu Dawud said: The name of the narrator Sam'an is Sam'an b. Mushannaj",
