He said “If you see that the birds are snatching at us, do not move from this place of yours until I send for you and if you see that we defeated the people (the enemy) and trod them down, do not move until I send for you. Allaah then defeated them. He (narrator) said “I swear by Allaah, I saw women ascending the mountain. The companions of ‘Abd Allaah bin Jubair said “Booty, O People, booty! Your companions vanquished, for what are you waiting?” ‘Ad Allaah bin Jubair said “Have you forgotten what the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) had told you?” They said “We swear by Allaah. We shall come to the people and get the booty. So they came to them. Their faces were turned and they came defeated.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (3039)"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":186}}}
