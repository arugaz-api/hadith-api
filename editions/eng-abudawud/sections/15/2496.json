    "text": "Buraidah reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “Respect to be shown by those who stay at home to the women of those who are engaged in jihad is t be like that shown to their mothers. If any man among those who stay at home is entrusted with the oversight of one’s family who is engaged in jihad and betrays him, he will be setup for him on the Day of Resurrection and he (the mujahid) will be told “This (man) was entrusted with the oversight of your family, so take what you want from his good deeds. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) turned towards us and said “So what do you think.” Abu Dawud said “Qa’nab (a narrator of this tradition) was a pious man. Ibn Abi Laila intended to appoint him a judge, but he refused and said “If I intend to fulfill my need of a dirham, I seek the help of a person for it. He said “Which of us does not seek the help in his need? He said “Bring me out so that I may see. So he was brought out, and he concealed himself. Sufyan said “While he was concealing himself.” Sufyan said “While he was concealing himself the house suddenly fell on him and he died.”",
