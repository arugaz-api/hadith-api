Aban ibn Sa'id and his companions came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at Khaybar after it had been captured. The girths of their horses were made of palm fibres. Aban said: Give us a share (from the booty), Messenger of Allah. AbuHurayrah said: I said: Do not give them a share, Messenger of Allah. Aban said: Why are you talking so, Wabr. You have come to us from the peak of Dal. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Sit down, Aban. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any share to them (from the booty)",
