I went out along with them, and got abundant riches. Our commander gave each of us a camel as a reward. We then came upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he divided the spoils of war among us. Each of us received twelve camels after taking a fifth of it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not take account of our companion (i.e. the commander of the army), nor did he blame him for what he had done. Thus each man of us had received thirteen camels with the reward he gave","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":267}}}
