Muhammad bin Maslamah stood up and said: I (shall do), Messenger of Allah. Do you want that I should kill him? He said: Yes. He said: So permit me to say something (against you). He said: Yes say. He then came to him (Ka’b b. al-Ashraf) and said to him: This man has asked us for sadaqah (alms) and has put us into trouble. He (Ka’b) said: You will be more grieved. He (Muhammad bin Maslamah) said: We have followed him and we do not like to forsake him until we see what will be the consequences of his matter. We wished if you could lend us one or two wasqs. Ka’b said: What will you mortgage with me? He asked: what do you want from us? He replied : your Women. They said: Glory be to Allah: You are the most beautiful of the Arabs. If we mortgage our women with you, that will be a disgrace for us. He said “The mortgage your children.” They said “Glory be to Allaah, a son of us may abuse saying “You were mortgaged for one or two wasqs.” They said “We shall mortgage or coat of mail with you. By this he meant arms”. He said “Yes, when he came to him, he called him and he came out while he used perfume and his head was spreading fragrance. When he at with him and he came there accompanied by three or four persons who mentioned his perfume. He said “I have such and such woman with me. She is most fragrant of the women among the people. He (Muhammad bin Maslamah) asked “Do you permit me so that I may smell? He said “Yes. He then entered his hand through his hair and smell it.” He said “May I repeat?” He said “Yes. He again entered his hand through his hair. When he got his complete control, he said “Take him. So he struck him until they killed him.”",
