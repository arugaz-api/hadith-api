A man had been dishonest about booty. Al Walid ordered to burn his property and it was circulated (among the people). He did not give him his share. Abu Dawud said “This is sounder of the two traditions. Others narrated that Al Walid bin Hashim burnt the Camel saddle of Ziyad bin Sa’d “He had been dishonest about booty and he beat him.”",
