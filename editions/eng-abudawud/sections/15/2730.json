    "text": "Narrated Umayr, client of AbulLahm: I was present at Khaybar along with my masters who spoke about me to the Messenger of Allah (ï·º). He ordered about me, and a sword was girded on me and I was trailing it. He was then informed that I was a slave. He, therefore, ordered that I should be given some inferior goods. Abu Dawud said: This means that he (the Prophet) did not allot a portion of the spoils. Abu Dawud said: Abu 'Ubaid said: As he (the narrator Abi al-Lahm) made eating meat unlawful on himself, he was called Abi al-Lahm (one who hates meat)",
