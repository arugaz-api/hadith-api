    "text": "Anas reported the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) as saying “He who kills and infidel gets his spoil.” Abu Talhah killed twenty men that day meaning the day of Hunain and got their spoils. Abu Talhah met Umm Sulaim who had a dagger with her. He asked “What is with you, Umm Sulaim”? She replied “I swear by Allaah, I intended that if anyone came near me I would pierce his belly with it. Abu Talhah informed the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)about it. Abu Dawud said “This is good (hasan) tradition.\" Abu Dawud said “By this was meant dagger. The weapon used by the Non – Arabs in those days was dagger.”",
