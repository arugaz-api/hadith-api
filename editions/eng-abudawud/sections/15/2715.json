    "text": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As: The Messenger of Allah (ï·º), AbuBakr and Umar burned the belongings of anyone who had been dishonest about booty and beat him. Abu Dawud said: 'Ali b. Bahr added on the authority of al-Walid, and I did not hear (a tradition) from him: And they denied him his share.\" Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by al-Walid b. 'Utbah from 'Abd al-Wahhab b. Najdah; They said: This has been transmitted by al-Walid, from Zuhair b. Muhammad, from 'Amr b. Shu'aib. 'Abd al-Wahhab b. Najdah al-Huti did not mention the words \"He denied him his share\" (as narrated by 'Ali b. Bahr from al-Walid)",
