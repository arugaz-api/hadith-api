    "text": "Narrated Sawdah daughter of Zam'ah: Yahya ibn Abdullah said: When the captives (of the battle of Badr) were brought, Sawdah daughter of Zam'ah was present with the children of Afra' at the halting place of their camels, that is, Awf and Mu'awwidh sons of Afra'. This happened before the prescription of veil for them. Sawdah said: I swear by Allah, I was with them when I came (from there to the people) and I was told: These are captives recently brought (here). I returned to my house, and the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) was there, and AbuZayd Suhayl ibn Amr was in the corner of the apartment and his hands were tied up on his neck with a rope. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. Abu Dawud said: They (the sons of 'Afra') killed Abu Jahl b. Hisham. They were deputed for him though they did not realize him: and they were killed in the battle of Badr",
