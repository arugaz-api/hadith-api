He made a public announcement, and when the people brought their booty, he would take a fifth and divide it. Thereafter a man brought a halter of hair and said: Messenger of Allah, this is a part of the booty we got. He asked: Have you heard Bilal making announcement three times? He replied: Yes. He asked: What did prevent you from bringing it? He made some excuse, to which he said: Be (as you are), you may bring it on the Day of Judgment, for I shall not accept it from you",
