The Prophet (ﷺ) said: You may have so much and so much. But they did not agree. He again said: You may have so much and so much. But they did not agree. He again said: You may have so much and so much. So they agreed. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: I am going to address the people in the afternoon and tell them about your consent. They said: Yes. Addressing (the people), the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: These people of faith came to me asking for revenge. I presented them with so much and so much and they agreed. Do you agree? They said: No. The immigrants (muhajirun) intended (to take revenge) on them. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded them to refrain and they refrained. He then called them and increased (the amount), and asked: Do you agree? They replied: Yes. He said: I am going to address the people and tell them about your consent. They said: Yes. The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed and said: Do you agree? They said: Yes","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":41,"hadith":41}}}
