Sahl was killed. The Jews were blamed (for the murder). 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl and Huwayyasah and Muhayyasah, the sons of his uncle (Mas'ud) came to the Prophet (ﷺ). 'Abd al-Rahman, who was the youngest, spoke about his brother, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: (Respect) the elder, (respect) the elder or he said: Let the eldest begin. They then spoke about their friend and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Fifty of you should take oaths regarding a man from them (the Jews) and he should be entrusted (to him) with his rope (in his neck). They said: It is a matter which we did not see. How can we take oaths ? He said: The Jews exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Messenger of Allah! they are a people who are infidels. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid them bloodwit himself. Sahl said: Once I entered the resting place of their camels, and the she-camel struck me with her lef. Hammad said this or (something) similar to it. Abu Dawud said: Another version transmitted by Yahya b. Sa'id has: Would you swear fifty oaths and make you claim regarding your friend or your slain man ? Bishr, the transmitter, did mention blood. 'Abdah transmitted it from Yahya as transmitted by Hammad. Ibn 'Uyainah has also transmitted it from Yahya, and began with his words: The Jew will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths which they will swear. He did not mention the claim. Abu Dawud said: This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah",
