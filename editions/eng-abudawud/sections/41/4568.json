    "text": "Narrated Al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah:A man of Hudhail has two wives. One of them struck her fellow-wife with a tent-pole and killed her and her unborn child. They brought the dispute to the Prophet (ï·º). One of two men said: How can we pay bloodwit for the one who did not make a noise, or ate, nor drank, nor raised his voice ? He (the Prophet) asked: Is it rhymed prose like that of bedouin? He gave judgement that a male or female slave of the best quality should be paid in compensation, and he fixed it to be paid by woman's relatives on her father's side",
