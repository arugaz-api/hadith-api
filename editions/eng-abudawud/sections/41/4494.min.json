When a man of Qurayzah killed a man of an-Nadir, he would be killed. But if a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah, a hundred wasq of dates would be paid as blood-money. When Prophethood was bestowed upon the Prophet (ﷺ), a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah. They said: Give him to us, we shall kill him. They replied: We have the Prophet (ﷺ) between you and us. So they came to him. Thereupon the following verse was revealed: \"If thou judge, judge in equity between them.\" \"In equity\" means life for a life. The following verse was then revealed: \"Do they seek of a judgment of (the days) ignorance?\" Abu Dawud said: Quraizah and al-Nadir were the descendants of Harun the Prophet (peace be upon him)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":41,"hadith":1}}}
