{"author":"Sunan Abu Dawud","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1355,"arabicnumber":1355,"text":"Narrated Fadl b. 'Abbas: I spent a night with the Prophet (ﷺ) to see how he prayed. He got up, performed ablution and prayed two rak'ahs. His standing was like his bowing (i.e. equal in duration), and his bowing was like his prostration (equal in length). Then he slept. Afterwards he awoke, performed ablution, and used tooth-stick. He then recited five verses from Surah Al-'Imran : \"In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day\". He went on doing so till he prayed ten rak'ahs. He then stood up and prayed one rak'ah observing witr with it. In the meantime the mu'adhdhin called to prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up after the mu'adhdhin had kept silent. He prayed two light rak'ahs and remained sitting till he offered the dawn prayer. Abu Dawud said: A part of the tradition transmitted by Ibn Bashshar remained hidden from me","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":106}}}
