    "text": "Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Shurayh ibn Hani said: I asked Aisha about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never offered the night prayer and thereafter came to me but he offered four or six rak'ahs of prayer. One night the rain fell, so we spread a piece of leather (for his prayer), and now I see as if there is a hole in it from which the water is flowing. I never saw him protecting his clothes from the earth (as he did on that occasion)",
