    "text": "Anas b. Malik reported:A man from the Ansar said: I am a corpulent man-and he was (actually) a fat man; I cannot pray along with you. He prepared food for him and invited him to his house. (he said) (please) pray (here) so that I may see how you pray, and then I would follow you. They (the people) washed one side of their mat. He (the prophet) then got up and prayed two Rakâ€™ahs. Ibn al-Jarud asked Anas b. Malik: would he (the prophet) say the forenoon prayer? He replied: I did not see him offering this prayer except that day",
