When he sat at the end of his prayer, one of the people said: Prayer has been established by virtue and purity. When AbuMusa returned (from his prayer or finished his prayer), he gave his attention to the people, and said: Which of you is the speaker of such and such words? The people remained silent. Which of you is the speaker of such and such words? The people remained silent. He said: You might have said them, Hittan. He replied: I did not say them. I was afraid you might punish me. One of the people said: I said them and I did not intend by them (anything) except good. AbuMusa said: Do you not know how you utter (them) in your prayer? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) addressed us, and taught us and explained to us our way of doing and taught us our prayer. He said: When you pray a (congregational) prayer, straighten your rows, then one of you should lead you in prayer. When he says the takbir (Allah is Most Great), say the takbir, and when he recites verses \"Not of those upon whom is Thy anger, nor of those who err\" (i.e. the end of Surah i.), say Amin; Allah will favour you. When he says \"Allah is most great,\" and bows, say \"Allah is most great\" and bow, for the imam will bow before you, and will raise (his head) before you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is for that. When he says \"Allah listens to the one who praises Him,\" say: \"O Allah, our Lord, to Thee be praise, Allah be praised,\" Allah will listen to you, for Allah, the Exalted, said by the tongue of His Prophet (ﷺ): \"Allah listens to the one who praises Him.\" When he says \"Allah is most great\" and prostrates, say: \"Allah is most great\" and prostrate, for the imam prostrates before you and raises his head before you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is for that. When he sits, each one of you should say \"The adorations of the tongue, all good things, and acts of worship are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon Allah's upright servants. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Apostle.\" This version of Ahmad does not mention the words \"and His blessings\" nor the phrase \"and I testify\"; instead, it has the words \"that Muhammad","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim (404)"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":583}}}
