You brought out the pulpit on the 'Id, it was not brought out before: and you began preaching before the prayer. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: Wh is this (man) ? They (people) said: So-and so son of so-and-so. He has performed his duty. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) say: He who observes and evil deed should change it with his hand if he can do so; if he cannot do, (he should change it) then with his tongue; if he cannot do then (he should change it) with his heart, and that is the weakest degree of the faith",
