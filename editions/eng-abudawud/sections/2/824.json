Then Ubadah came and I was with him. We Joined the row behind Abu Nu’aim, while Abu Nu’aim was reciting the Qur’an loudly. Then ‘Ubadah began to recite the Umm al-Quran (I.e Surah al Fatihah). When he finished, I said to Ubadah: I heard you reciting the Umm al-Qur’an while Abu Nu’aim was reciting Qur’an loudly. He replied: yes> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led us in a certain prayer in which the Qur’an is recited loudly, but he became confused in the recitation. When he finished he turned his face to us and said: Do you recite when I recite the Qur’an loudly? Some of us said: we do so; this is why I said to myself: What is that which confused me (in the recitation of ) the Qur’an. Do not recite anything from the Qur’an when I recite it loudly except the Umm al-Qur’an",
