Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by 'Abd al-Wahid from Khusaif, but he did not report it as a statement of the Prophet (ﷺ). The version of 'Abd al-Wahid has been corroborated by Sufyan, Sharik, and Isra'il. They differed amongst themselves about the text of the tradition and they did not narrate it with the continuous chain up to the Prophet (ﷺ)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":639}}}
