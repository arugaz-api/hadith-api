AbuHurayrah replied: Yes. Marwan then asked: When? AbuHurayrah said: On the occasion of the Battle of Najd. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up to offer the afternoon prayer. One section stood with him (to pray) and the other was standing before the enemy, and their backs were towards the qiblah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered the takbir and all of them too uttered the takbir, i.e. those who were with him and those who were facing the enemy. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered one rak'ah and the section that was with him also prayed one rak'ah. He then prostrated himself and those who were with him also prostrated, while the other section was standing before the enemy. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then stood up and the section with him also stood up. They went and faced the enemy and the section that was previously facing the enemy stepped forward. They bowed and prostrated while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing in the same position. Then they stood up and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon) prayed another rak'ah and all of them bowed and prostrated along with him. After that the section that was standing before the enemy came forward and they bowed and prostrated, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained seated and also those who were with him. The salutation then followed. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) uttered the salutation and all of them uttered it together. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed two rak'ahs and each of the two sections prayed one rak'ah with him (and the other by themselves)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":43}}}
