    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas explained the following Qur'anic verse :\"To those also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give your portion.\" When the Emigrants came to Medina. they inherited from the Helpers without any blood-relationship with them for the brotherhood which the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) established between them. When the following verse was revealed: \"To (benefit) everyone we have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parent and relatives.\" it abrogated the verse: \"To those also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give their due portion.\" This alliance was made for help, well wishing and cooperation. Now a legacy can be made for him. (The right to)inheritance was abolished",
