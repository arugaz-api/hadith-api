They replied: The daughter gets half and the full gets half. The son's daughter gets nothing. Go to Ibn Mas'ud and you will find that he agrees with me. So the man came to him and informed him about their opinion. He said: I would then be in error and not be one of those who are rightly guided. But I decide concerning the matter as the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) did: The daughter gets half, and the son's daughter gets a share which complete thirds (i.e. gets a sixth), and what remain to the full sister",
