    "text": "Narrated Uqbah ibn Amir: The Prophet (ﷺ) said to a man: Would you like me to marry you to so-and-so? He said: Yes. He also said to the woman: Would you like me to marry you to so-and-so? She said: Yes. He then married one to the other. The man had sexual intercourse with her, but he did not fix any dower for her, nor did he give anything to her. He was one of those who participated in the expedition to al-Hudaybiyyah. One part of the expedition to al-Hudaybiyyah had a share in Khaybar. When he was nearing his death, he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) married me to so-and-so, and I did not fix a dower for her, nor did I give anything to her. I call upon you as witness that I have given my share in Khaybar as her dower. So she took the share and sold it for one lakh (of dirhams). Abu Dawud said: The version of 'Umar b. al-Khattab added in the beginning of this tradition, and his version is more perfect. He reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: The best marriage is the one that is most easy. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to the man. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition to the same effect. Abu Dawud said: I am afraid this tradition has been added later on, for the matter is otherwise",
