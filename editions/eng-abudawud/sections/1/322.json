Abza said:While I was with 'Umar, a man came to him and said: We live at a place (where water is not found) for a month or two (what should we do, if we are sexually defiled). 'Umar said: So far as I am concerned, I do not pray until I find water. 'Ammar said: Commanded of the faithful, do you not remember when I and you were among the camels (For tending them)? There we became sexually defiled. I rolled down on the ground. We then came to the Prophet (ï·º) and I mentioned that to him. He said: It was enough for you to do so. Then he struck the ground with both his hands. He then blew over them and wiped his face and both hands by means of them up to half the arms. 'Umar said: 'Ammar, fear Allah. He said: Commander of the faithful, if you want, I will never narrate it. 'Umar said: Nay, by Allah, we shall turn you from that towards which you turned (i.e. you have your choice)",
