She replied:I was (lying) with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we had our garment over us, and we had put a blanket over it. When the day broke, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took the blanket, wore it and went out and offered the dawn prayer. He then sat (in the mosque among the people). A man said: Messenger of Allah, this is a spot of blood. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) caught hold of it from around and sent it to me folded in the hand of a slave and said: Wash it and dry it and then send it to me. I sent for my vessel and washed it. I then dried it and returned it to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came at noon while he had the blanket over him","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":388}}}
