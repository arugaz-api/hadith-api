    "text": "Anas reported :The Prophet (ﷺ) performed ablution with a vessel which contained two rotls (of water) and took a bath with a sa’ (of water).1 Abu Dawud Said : This tradition has berated on the authority of Anas through a different chain. This version mentions: “He performed ablution with one makkuk. “It makes no mention of two rotls. 2 Abu Dawud said : This tradition has also been narrated by Yahya b. Adam from Sharik. But this chain mentions Ibn Jabr b. ‘Atik instead of ‘ Abd Allah b. Jabr. Abu Dawud Said : This tradition has also been narrated by Sufyan from ‘Abd Allah b. ‘Isa. This chain mentions the name Jabr b. ‘Abd Allah instead of ‘Abd Allah b. Jabr. Abu Dawud Said : I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say : one sa’ measures five rotls. It was the sa’ of Ibn Abi Dhi’b and also of the Prophet (ﷺ)",
