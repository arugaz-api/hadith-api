    "text": "Urwah b. al-Zubair said:Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish narrated to me that she asked Asma' (daughter of Abu Bakr), or Asma' narrated to me that Fatimah daughter of Abu Hubaish asked her to question the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He advised her to refrain (from prayer) equal to the period she refrained previously. She then should wash herself.1 Abu Dawud said: Qatadah narrated it from 'Urwah b. al-Zubair, from Zainab daughter of Umm Salamah, that Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded her to abandon prayer for the period of her menses. She then should take a bath, and offer prayer. Abu Dawud said: Qatadah did not hear anything from 'Urwah. 2 And Ibn 'Uyainah added in the tradition narrated by al-Zuhri from 'Umrah on the authority of 'Aishah. Umm Habibah had a prolonged flow of blood. She asked the Prophet (ﷺ). He commanded her to abandon prayer during her menstrual period. Abu Dawud said: This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah. This is not found in the tradition reported by the transmitter from al-Zuhri except that mentioned by Suhail b. Abu Salih. Al-Humaidi also narrated this tradition from Ibn 'Uyainah, but he did not mention the words \"she should abandon prayer during her menstrual period.\"1 Qumair daughter of Masruq reported on the authority of 'Aishah: The woman who has prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer during her menstrual period.3 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Qasim reported on the authority of his father: The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded her to abandon prayers equal (to the length of time) that she has her (usual) menses.2 Abu Bishr Ja'far b. Abi Wahshiyyah reported on the authority of 'Ikrimah from the Prophet (ﷺ) saying: Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood; and he transmitted like that.1 Sharik narrated from Abu al-Yaqzan from 'Adi b. Thabit from his father on the authority of his grandfather from the Prophet (ﷺ): The woman suffering from a prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer during her menstrual period ; she then should was herself and pray. 1 Al-'Ala b. al-Musayyab reported from al-Hakam on the authority of Abu Ja'far, saying: Saudah had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded that when he menstruation was finished, she should take bath and pray.1 Sa'id b. Jubair reported from 'Ali and Ibn 'Abbas : A woman suffering from a prolonged flow of blood should refrain from prayers during her menstrual period.1 'Ammar, the freed slave of Banu Hashim and Talq b. Habib narrated in a similar way.1 Similarly, it was reported by Ma'qil al-Khath'ami from 'Ali4, al-Sha'bi also transmitted it in a similar manner from Qumair, the wife of Masruq, on the authority of 'Aishah.1 Abu Dawud said: Al-Hasan, Sa'id b. al-Musayyab, 'Ata, Makhul, Ibrahim, Salim and al-Qasim also hold that a woman suffering from a prolonged flow of blood should abandon prayer during her menstrual period. Abu Dawud said: Qatadah did not hear anything from 'Urwah",
