The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: Glory be to Allah! This comes from the devil. She should sit in a tub, and when she sees yellowness of the top of the water, she would take a bath once for the Zuhr and 'Asr prayer, and take another bath for the Maghrib and 'Isha prayers, and take a bath once for the fajr prayer, and in between times she would perform ablution. Abu Dawud said: Mujahid reported on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas: When bathing became hard for her, he commanded her to combine the two prayers. Abu Dawud said: Ibrahim reported it from Ibn 'Abbas. This is also the view of Ibrahim al-Nakha'i and 'Abd Allah b.
