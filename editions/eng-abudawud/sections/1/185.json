He (the Prophet) inserted his hand between the skin and the flesh until it reached the armpit. He then went away and led the people in prayer and he did not perform ablution. The version of Amr added that he did not touch water. Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated though another chain of transmitters, making no mention of Abu Sa'id",
