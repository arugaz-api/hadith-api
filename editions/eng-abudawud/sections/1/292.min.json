He commanded her to take bath for every prayer. The narrator then transmitted the tradition (in full). Abu Dawud said: It has also been narrated by Abu al-Walid al-Tayalisi, but I did not hear him. He reported it from 'Aishah through a different chain of narrators. 'Aishah said: Zainab daughter of Jahsh had a prolonged flow of blood. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to her: Take bath for every prayer. The narrator then reported the tradition (in full). Abu Dawud said: The version transmitted by 'Abd al-Samad from Sulaiman b. Kathir has: \"Perform ablution for every prayer.\" This is a misunderstanding on the part of 'Abd al-Samad. The correct version is the one narrated by Abu al-Walid","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":292}}}
