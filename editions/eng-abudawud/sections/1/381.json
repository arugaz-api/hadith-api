    "text": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Ma'qil ibn Muqarrin: A bedouin prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ). He then narrated the tradition (No 0380) about urinating of that bedouin. This version adds: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Remove the earth where he urinated and throw it away and pour water upon the place. Abu Dawud said: This is a mursal tradition (i.e. the narrator quotes the Prophet (ﷺ) directly, although he did not see him). Ibn Ma'qil did not see the Prophet (ﷺ)",
