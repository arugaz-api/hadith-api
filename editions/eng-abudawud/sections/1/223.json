    "text": "This Tradition has been narrated on the Authority of al-Zuhri through a different chain. It adds :If he intends to eat while he is defiled, he should wash both his hands. Abu Dawud said: Ibn Wahb narrated this tradition on the authority of Yunus. He described the fact of eating as the statement of ‘A’ishah (not the saying of the prophet). It has also been narrated it from ‘Urwah or Abu Salamah. Al-Awza’I narrated it from Yunus on the Authority of Al-Zuhri from the prophet (ﷺ) as narrated by Ibn al-Mubarak",
