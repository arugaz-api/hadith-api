    "text": "Narrated Ibn 'Abbas : The Prophet (sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam ) passed by two graves. He said : Both (the dead) are being punished, but they are not being punished for a major (sin). One did not safeguard himself from urine. The other carried tales. He then called for a fresh twig and split it into two parts and planted one part on each grave and said: Perhaps their punishment may be mitigated as long as the twigs remain fresh. Another version of Hannad has: \"One of them did not cover himself while urinating.\" This version does not have the words: \"He did not safeguard himself from urine",
