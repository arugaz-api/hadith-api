    "text": "Aishah said:Umm Habibah, daughter of Jahsh and sister-in-law of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)m and wife of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. She inquired from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is not menstruation, but this (due to) a vein. Therefore, wash yourself and pray. Abu Dawud said: In this tradition which is transmitted by al-Zuhri from 'Urwah and 'Urwah on the authority of 'Aishah, al-Awza'i added: She ('Aishah) said: Umm Habibah daughter of Jahsh and wife of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. The Prophet (ﷺ) commander her saying: When the menstruation begins, abandon prayer; when it is finished, take a bath and pray. Abu Dawud said: None of the disciple of al-Zuhri mentioned these words except al-Awza'i, from al-Zuhri it has been narrated by 'Amr b. al-Harith, al-Laith, Yunus, Ibn Abi Dhi'b, Ma'mar, Ibrahim b. Sa'd, Sulaiman b. Kathir, Ibn Ishaq and Sufyan b. 'Uyainah, they did not narrate these words. Abu Dawud said: These are the words of the version reported by Hisham b. 'Urwah from this father on the authority of 'Aishah. Abu Dawud said: In this tradition Ibn 'Uyainah also added the words: He commander her to abandon prayer during her menstrual period. This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah. The version of this tradition narrated by Muhammad b. 'Amr from al-Zuhri has the addition similar to that made by al-Awza'i in his version",
