She was commanded to advance the afternoon prayer and delay the noon prayer, and to take a bath for them only once; and to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer and to take a bath only once for them; and to take a bath separately for the dawn prayer. I (Shu'bah) asked AbdurRahman: (Is it) from the Prophet (ﷺ)? I do not report to you anything except from the Prophet (ﷺ)",
