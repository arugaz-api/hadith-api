    "text": "â€˜Umar b. al-Khattab reported the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) as saying :Moses said : My lord, show us Adam who caused us and himself to come out from Paradise. So Allah showed him Adam. He asked : Are you our father, Adam? Adam said to him : Yes. He said : Are you the one into whom Allah breathed of his spirit, taught you all the names, and commanded angels (to prostrate) and they prostrated to you? He replied : Yes. He asked : Then what moved you to cause us and yourself to come out from paradise? Adam asked him : And who are you? He said : Yes. He asked : Did you not find that was decreed in the book (records) of Allah before I was created? He replied : Yes. He asked : Then why do you blame me about a thing for which Divine decree had already passed before me ? The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : So Adam got the better of Moses in argument (peace be upon him)",
