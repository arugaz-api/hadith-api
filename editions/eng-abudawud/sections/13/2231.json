He is your husband and father of your child”. She said “Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) do you command me for that? He said No, I am only interceding. Then tears were falling down on his (her husband’s) cheeks. The Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) said to ‘Abbas “Are you not surprised with the love of Mughith for Barirah and her hatred for him.”",
