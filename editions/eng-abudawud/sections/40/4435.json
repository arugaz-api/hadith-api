I then went to the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was asking: Who is the father of this (child) who is with you? She remained silent. A young man by her side said: I am his father, Messenger of Allah! He then turned towards her and asked: Who is the father of this child with you? The young man said: I am his father, Messenger of Allah! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then looked at some of those who were around him and asked them about him. They said: We only know good (about him). The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: Are you married? He said: Yes. So he gave orders regarding him and he was stoned to death. He (the narrator) said: We took him out, dug a pit for him and put him in it. We then threw stones at him until he died. A man then came asking about the man who was stoned. We brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: This man has come asking about the wicked man. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He is more agreeable than the fragrance of musk in the eyes of Allah. The man was his father. We then helped him in washing, shrouding and burying him. (The narrator said:) I do not know whether he said or did not say \"in praying over him.\" This is the tradition of Abdah, and it is more accurate",
