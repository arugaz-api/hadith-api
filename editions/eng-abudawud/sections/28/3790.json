    "text": "Narrated Khalid ibn al-Walid: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade us to eat horse-flesh, the flesh of mules and of asses. The narrator Haywah added: Every beast of prey with a fang. Abu Dawud said: This view is held by Malik. Abu Dawud said: There is no harm in (eating) horse-flesh and this tradition is not practised. Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been abrogated. A body of Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) had eaten horse-flesh. OF them are: Ibn al-Zubair, Fudalah bin 'Ubaid, Anas bin Malik, Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr, Suwaid bin Ghaflah, 'Alqamah; the Quraish used to slaughter them (horses) during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)",
