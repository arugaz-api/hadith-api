    "text": "‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) told that when the evening came, the prophet (May peace be upon him) would say:we have come to the evening, and in the evening the dominion belongs to Allah: “Praise be to Allah; there is no god but Allah alone who has no partner”. The version of Jarir adds: Zubaid said that Ibrahim b. Suwaid said: There is no god but Allah alone who has no partner; to him belongs the dominion, to him praise is due, and He is omnipotent. O Allah! I ask thee for the good of what this night contains, and the good of what comes after it; and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of what this night contains, and from the evil of what comes after it. My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from indolence, the evil of old age or of disbelief. My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from a punishment in Hell and a punishment in the grave. In the morning he said that also: we have come to the morning, and in the morning the dominion belongs to Allah. Abu Dawud said: Shu’bah transmitted from Salamah b. Kuhail, from Ibrahim b. Suwaid, saying: from the evil of old age. He did not mention the evil of disbelief",
