So when he entered, he caught hold of her in order to slap her, and said: Do I see you raising your voice to the Messenger of Allah? The Prophet (ﷺ) began to prevent him and AbuBakr went out angry. The Prophet (ﷺ) said when AbuBakr went out: You see I rescued you from the man. AbuBakr waited for some days, then asked permission of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to enter, and found that they had made peace with each other. He said to them: Bring me into your peace as you brought me into your war. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: We have done so: we have done so",
