When I remembered three days later, I went to that place and found him there. He said: You have vexed me, young man. I have been here for three days waiting for you. Abu Dawud said: Muhammad b. Yahya said : This is, in our opinion, 'Abd al-Karim b. 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq (instead of \"from 'Abd al-Karim from 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq\"). Abu Dawud said: In a similar way I have been informed by 'Ali b. 'Abd Allah. Abu Dawud said: I have been told that Bishr b. al-Sarri transmitted it from 'Abd Allah b. Shaqiq","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":224}}}
