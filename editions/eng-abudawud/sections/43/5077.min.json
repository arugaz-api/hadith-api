He will have ten good deeds recorded for him, ten evil deeds deducted from him, he will be advanced ten degrees, and will be guarded from the Devil till the evening. If he says them in the evening, he will have a similar recompense till the morning. The version of Hammad says: A man saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a dream and said: Messenger of Allah! AbuAyyash is relating such and such on your authority. He said: AbuAyyash has spoken the truth. Abu Dawud said: Isma'il b. Ja'far, Musa al-Zim'i and 'Adb Allah b.
