I said: Give me some advice. He said: Do not abuse anyone. He said that he did not abuse a freeman, or a slave, or a camel or a sheep thenceforth. He said: Do not look down upon any good work, and when you speak to your brother, show him a cheerful face. This is a good work. Have your lower garment halfway down your shin; if you cannot do it, have it up to the ankles. Beware of trailing the lower garment, for it is conceit and Allah does not like conceit.

        "text": "Narrated Qays ibn Bishr at-Taghlibi: My father told me that he was a companion of Abu Darda'. There was in Damascus a man from the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), called Ibn al-Hanzaliyyah. He was a recluse and rarely met the people. He remained engaged in prayer. When he was not praying he was occupied in glorifying Allah and exalting Him until he went to his family. Once he passed us when we were with AbudDarda'. AbudDarda' said to him: Tell us a word which benefits us and does not harm you. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent out a contingent and it came back. One of the men came and sat in the place where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to sit, and he said to a man beside him: Would that you saw us when we met the enemy and so-and-so attacked and cut through a lance. He said: Take it from me and I am a boy of the tribe Ghifar. What do you think about his statement? He replied: I think his reward was lost. Another man heard it and said: I do not think that there is any harm in it. They quarrelled until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) heard it, and he said: Glory be to Allah! There is no harm if he is rewarded and praised. I saw that AbudDarda' was pleased with it and began to raise his hand to him and say: Did you hear it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: Yes. He continued to repeat it to him so often that I thought he was going to kneel down. He said: On another day he again passed us. AbudDarda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: One who spends on (the maintenance of) horses (for jihad) is like the one who spreads his hand to give alms (sadaqah) and does not withhold it. He then passed us on another day. AbudDarda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does no harm to you. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Khuraym al-Asadi would be a fine man were it not for the length of his hair, which reaches the shoulders, and the way he lets his lower garment hang down. When Khuraym heard that, he hurriedly, took a knife, cut his hair in line with his ears and raised his lower garment half way up his legs. He then passed us on another day. AbudDarda' said to him: (tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: You are coming to your brethren; so tidy your mounts and tidy your dress, until you are like a mole among the people. Allah does not like obscene words or deeds, or do intentional committing of obscenity. Abu Dawud said: Similarly, Abu Nu'aim narrated from Hisham. He said: Until you will be like a mole among the people",

Al-Miqdam recited the Qur'anic verse \"We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.\" A man asked him: Do you think it a calamity? He replied: Why should I not consider it a calamity when it is a fact that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to take him on his lap, saying: This belongs to me and Husayn belongs to Ali? The man of Banu Asad said: (He was) a live coal which Allah has extinguished. Al-Miqdam said: Today I shall continue to make you angry and make you hear what you dislike. He then said: Mu'awiyah, if I speak the truth, declare me true, and if I tell a lie, declare me false. He said: Do so. He said: I adjure you by Allah, did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbidding use to wear gold? He replied: Yes. He said: I adjure you by Allah, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited the wearing of silk? He replied: Yes. He said: I adjure you by Allah, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited the wearing of the skins of beasts of prey and riding on them? He said: Yes. He said: I swear by Allah, I saw all this in your house, O Mu'awiyah. Mu'awiyah said: I know that I cannot be saved from you, O Miqdam. Khalid said: Mu'awiyah then ordered to give him what he did not order to give to his two companions, and gave a stipend of two hundred (dirhams) to his son. Al-Miqdam then divided it among his companions, and the man of Banu Asad did not give anything to anyone from the property he received. When Mu'awiyah was informed about it, he said: Al-Miqdam is a generous man; he has an open hand (for generosity). The man of Banu Asad withholds his things in a good manner",

        "text": "Narrated AbuHurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Gabriel (ﷺ) came to me and said: I came to you last night and was prevented from entering simply because there were images at the door, for there was a decorated curtain with images on it in the house, and there was a dog in the house. So order the head of the image which is in the house to be cut off so that it resembles the form of a tree; order the curtain to be cut up and made into two cushions spread out on which people may tread; and order the dog to be turned out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then did so. The dog belonged to al-Hasan or al-Husayn and was under their couch. So he ordered it to be turned out. Abu Dawud said: Al-Nadd means a thing on which clothes are placed like a couch",
