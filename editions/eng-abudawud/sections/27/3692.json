    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas said:The deputation of 'Abd al-Qais came to Messenger of Allah (ï·º) and said: This is the tribe of Rabi'ah, and the infidels of Mudar are between us and you. We are able to come to you only in the sacred month. So give a decisive command which we may follow ourselves and to which we call those at home behind us. He (the Prophet) said: I command you to observe four things, and forbade you four things: Belief in Allah. the testimony that there is no god but Allah, and he expresses one by folding his hand. Musadad's version has: Faith in Allah, and he explained to them: The testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, observance of prayer, payment of zakat, and your giving the filth of the booty. I forbid you the use of pumpkins, green jarrs, vessels smeared with pitch, and hollow stumps of palm-trees. Ibn 'Ubaid's version has word muqayyar (vessels smeared with pitch) instead of naqir (hollow stumps). Musaddad's version has naqir and muqayyar (pitch); he did not mention muzaffat (vessels smeared with pitch). Abu Dawud said: The name of Abu Jamrah is Nasr bin 'Imran al-Duba'i",
