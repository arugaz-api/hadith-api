Will you remember your family on the 4th Day of resurrection ? the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said : There are three places where no one will remember anyone: at the scale until one knows whether his weight is light or heavy; at (the examination of) the book when one is commanded : Take and read Allah’s record, until he knows whether his book will be put into his right hand, or into his left hand, or behind his back ; and the path when it is placed across JAHANNAM",
