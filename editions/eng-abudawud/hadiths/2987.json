    "text": "Umm Al Hakam or Duba’ah daughters of Al Zibair bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib said “Some captives of war were brought to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). I and my sister Fatimah, daughter of Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went (to the Prophet) and complained to him about our existing condition. We asked him to order (to give) us some captives. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “the orphans of the people who were killed in the battle of Badr came before you (and they asked for the captives). But I tell you something better than that. You should utter “Allaah is Most Great” after each prayer thirty three times, “Glory be to Allaah” thirty three times, “Praise be to Allaah” thirty three times and “there is no god but Allaah alone, He has no associate, the Kingdom belongs to Him and praise is due to Him and He has power over all things.” The narrator ‘Ayyash said “They were daughters of Uncle of the Prophet (ﷺ).”",
