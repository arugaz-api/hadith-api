He said “We came to the valley where the people make their Camels kneel down to take rest at night.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) made his she Camel kneel down and he then urinated. He then called for water for ablution and performed the ablution but he did not perform minutely (but performed lightly). I asked Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), prayer? He replied “Prayer ahead of you”. He then mounted (the Camel) till we came to Al Muzadalifah. There iqamah for the sunset prayer was called. The people then made their Camels kneel down at their places. The Camels were not unloaded as yet, iqamah for the night prayers was called and he prayed. The people then unloaded the Camels. The narrator Muhammad added in his version of the tradition How did you do when the morning came? He replied Al Fadl rode behind him and I walked on foot among the people of the Quraish who went ahead","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim (1280)"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":201}}}
