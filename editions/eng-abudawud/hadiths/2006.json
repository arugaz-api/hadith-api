Abu Dawud said: Ibn Bashshar did not mention that she was sent to al-Tan'im in this tradition. She said: I then came to him in the morning. He announced to his companions for departure, and he himself departed. He passed the house (the Ka'bah) before the dawn prayer, and went round it when he proceeded. He then went away facing Medina",
