Al-Hadrami said: Messenger of Allah, this (man) took away forcibly from me the land which belongs to my father. Al-Kindi said: It is my land in my possession, and I cultivate it, he has no right to it. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said to al-Hadrami: Have you any proof ? He said: No. He then said: So for you is his oath. He said: Messenger of Allah, he is liar, he does not care for which he is taking the oath. He does not refrain himself from anything. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: You will have nothing from him except that. He went to take an oath for him. When he turned his back, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: If he takes an oath on the property to take it away by unfair means, he will meet Allah while He is unmindful of him","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim (139)"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":4}}}
