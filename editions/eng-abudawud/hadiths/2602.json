When he put his foot in the stirrup, he said: \"In the name of Allah.\" Then when he sat on its back, he said: \"Praise be to Allah.\" He then said: \"Glory be to Him Who has made this subservient to us, for we had not the strength, and to our Lord do we return.\" He then said: \"Praise be to Allah (thrice); Allah is Most Great (thrice): glory be to Thee, I have wronged myself, so forgive me, for only Thou forgivest sins.\" He then laughed. He was asked: At what did you laugh? He replied: I saw the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) do as I have done, and laugh after that. I asked: Messenger of Allah , at what are you laughing? He replied: Your Lord, Most High, is pleased with His servant when he says: \"Forgive me my sins.\" He know that no one forgives sins except Him",
