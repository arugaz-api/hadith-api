'Amr: On the authority of his father: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) say in the Farewell Pilgrimage: \"Lo, all claims to usury of the pre-Islamic period have been abolished. You shall have your capital sums, deal not unjustly and you shall not be dealt with unjustly. Lo, all claims for blood-vengeance belonging to the pre-Islamic period have been abolished.

They said: Yes, saying it three times. He then said: O Allah, be witness, saying it three times",
