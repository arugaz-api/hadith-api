He said “They spoke the truth (in part) and told a lie (in part).” I asked “What truth did they speak and what lie did they tell?” He said “They spoke the truth that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) walked proudly while going round the Ka’bah but they told a lie, this is no sunnah. The Quraish asserted during the days of Al Hudaibiyyah “Forsake Muhammad and his Companions till they die the death of a Camel which dies of bacteria in its nose. When they concluded a treaty with him agreeing upon the fact that they (the Prophet and his Companions) would come (to Makkah) next year and stay at Makkah three days, the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said to the Companions “Walk proudly (moving shoulders) while going round the Ka’bah in first three circuits. (Ibn ‘Abbas said) But this is not sunnah. I said “Your people think that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) ran between Al Safa and Al Marwah on a Camel and that is sunnah.” He said “They spoke the truth (in part) and told a lie (in part).
