    "text": "Narrated AbuHurayrah: A man who was beautiful came to the Prophet (ï·º). He said: Messenger of Allah, I am a man who likes beauty, and I have been given some of it, as you see. And I do not like that anyone excels me (in respect of beauty). Perhaps he said: \"even to the extent of thong of my sandal (shirak na'li)\", or he he said: \"to the extent of strap of my sandal (shis'i na'li)\". Is it pride? He replied: No, pride is disdaining what is true and despising people",
