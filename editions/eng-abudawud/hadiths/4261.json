    "text": "Narrated AbuDharr: The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said to me: O AbuDharr. I replied: At thy service and at thy pleasure, Messenger of Allah. He then mentioned the tradition in which he said: What will you do when there the death of the people (in Medina) and a house will reach the value of a slave (that is, a grave will be sold for a slave). I replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. Or he said: What Allah and His Apostle choose for me. He said: You must show endurance. Or he said; you may endure. He then said to me: What will you do, AbuDharr, when you see the Ahjar az-Zayt covered with blood? I replied: What Allah and His Apostle choose for me. He said: You must go to those who are like-minded. I asked: Should I not take my sword and put it on my shoulder? He replied: you would then associate yourself with the people. I then asked: What do you order me to do? You must stay at home. I asked: (What should I do) if people enter my house and find me? He replied: If you are afraid the gleam of the sword may dazzle you, put the end of your garment over your face in order that (the one who kills you) may bear the punishment of your sins and his. Abu Dawud said: No one mentioned al-Mush'ath in the chain of this tradition except Hammad b. Zaid",
