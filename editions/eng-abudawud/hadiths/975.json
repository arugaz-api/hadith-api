    "text": "Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub: The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) commanded us (to recite) when we sit in the middle of the prayer or at its end before the salutation: The adorations of the tongue, all good things, acts of worship, and the Kingdom are due to Allah. Then give salutation to the right side; then salute your reciter (i.e. the imam) and yourselves. Abu Dawud said: Sulaiman b. Musa hails from Kufah and he lives in Damascus. Abu Dawud said: This collection of traditions indicates that al-Hasan (al-Basri) heard traditions from Samurah (b. Jundub)",
