The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was presented a black slave called Mid’am. And while they were in Wadi Al Qura and Mid’am was unsaddling a Camel belonging to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) he was struck by a random arrow which killed him. The people said “Congratulations to him, he will go to paradise. But the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “Not at all. By Him in Whose hand my soul is the cloak he took on the day of Khaibar from the spoils which was not among the shares divided will blaze with fire upon him. When they (the people) heard that, a man brought a sandal strap or two sandal straps to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) said “A sandal strap of fire or two sandal straps of fire.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (6707) Sahih Muslim (115)"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":235}}}
