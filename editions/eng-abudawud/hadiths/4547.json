    "text": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr: (Musaddad's version has): The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) made a speech on the day of the conquest of Mecca, and said: Allah is Most Great, three times. He then said: There is no god but Allah alone: He fulfilled His promise, helped His servant, and alone defeated the companies. (The narrator said:) I have remembered from Musaddad up to this. Then the agreed version has: Take note! All the merits mentioned in pre-Islamic times, and the claim made for blood or property are under my feet, except the supply of water to the pilgrims and the custody of the Ka'bah. He then said: The blood-money for unintentional murder which appears intentional, such as is done with a whip and a stick, is one hundred camels, forty of which are pregnant. Musaddad's version is more accurate",
