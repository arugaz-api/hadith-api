A man came and said Apostle of Allaah being ignorant, I shaved before sacrificing. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) replied “Sacrifice, for no harm will come.” Another man came and said “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), being ignorant, I sacrificed before throwing the pebbles.” He replied “Throw them for no harm will come.” He (the Prophet) was not asked about anything which had been done before or after its proper time without saying “Do it, for no harm will come.”",
