He was asked: Messenger of Allah, what do you think of the fat of animals which had died a natural death, for it was used for caulking ships, greasing skins, and making oil for lamps? He replies: No, it is forbidden. Thereafter, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: May Allah curse the Jews! When Allah declared the fat of such animals lawful, they melted it, then sold it, and enjoyed the price they received",
