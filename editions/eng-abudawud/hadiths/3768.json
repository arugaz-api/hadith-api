    "text": "Narrated Umayyah ibn Makhshi: Umayyah was sitting and a man was eating. He did not mention Allah's name until there remained the last morsel. When he raised it to his mouth, he said: In the name of Allah at the beginning and at the end of it. The Prophet (ï·º) laughed and said: The devil kept eating along with him, but when he mentioned Allah's name, he vomited what was in his belly. Abu Dawud: Jabir bin Subh is grandfather of Sulaiman bin Harb from his mother's side",
