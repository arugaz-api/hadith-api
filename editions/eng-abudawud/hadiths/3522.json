    "text": "A similar tradition (to the No. 3513) has been transmitted by AbuHurayrah from the Prophet (ï·º). This version has:If he paid something from its price, then he will be equal to the creditors in the remaining price. If a man dies and he has the very property of a man (i.e. seller), he is equal to the creditors whether he (the buyer) pays him (the price) or not. Abu Dawud said: Malik's version of this tradition is sounder",
