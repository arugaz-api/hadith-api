Then a man named Muslim who was there in the company mentioned it to me. When Ubaydullah saw him, he said: This Muhammadan [i.e. Companion of Muhammad (ﷺ)] of yours is short and fat. The old man (i.e. AbuBarzah) understood it. So he said: I did not think I would remain amongst a people who would criticize me for having had the company of Muhammad (ﷺ). Thereupon Ubaydullah said to him: The company of Muhammad (ﷺ) is a honour for you, not a disgrace. He added: I called for you to ask about the Haud (reservoir or cistern). Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say anything about it? AbuBarzah said: Yes, not once, twice, thrice, four times or five times. Whoever disbelieves in it, may Allah not supply him with water from it. He then went away angrily","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":154}}}
