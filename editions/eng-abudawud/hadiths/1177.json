He then bowed, then raised his head, then he bowed and then he raised his head, and again he bowed and prayed two rak'ahs of prayer. In each rak'ah he bowed three times. After bowing for the third time he prostrated himself. He stood for such a long time that some people became unconscious on that occasion and buckets of water had to be poured on them. When he bowed, he said, Allah is most great; and when he raised his head, he said, Allah listens to him who praises Him, till the sun became bright. then he said: The sun and the moon are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death or on account of anyone's birth, but they are two of Allah's signs, He produces dread in His servants by means of them. When they are eclipsed, hasten to prayer",
