    "text": "Ai’shah said :We raised our voices in talbiyah for Hajj. When we reached Sarif, I menstruated. The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) came upon me while I was weeping. He asked, why are your weeping, Ai’shah? I replied, I menstruated. Would that I had not come out for performing Hajj. He said : Glory be to Allah, this is a thing prescribed by Allah on the daughters of Adam. He said perform all the rites of Hajj but do not go round the House (the Ka’bah). When we entered Makkah, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) said he who desires to make (his Hajj) an `Umrah may do so, except those who have sacrificial animals with them. The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) sacrificed a cow on behalf of his wives on the day of sacrifice. When the night of al-Batha came, and Ai’shah was purified she said to the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) my fellow female pilgrims will return after performing Hajj and `Umrah and I shall return after performing only Hajj? He therefore, ordered `Abd al-Rahman bin Abu Bakr who took her to al-Ta’nim. She uttered there talbiyah for `Umrah",
