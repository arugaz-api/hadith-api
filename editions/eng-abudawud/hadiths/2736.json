When we returned, the people were driving their camels quickly. The people said to one another: What is the matter with them? They said: Revelation has come down to the Prophet (ﷺ). We also proceeded with the people, galloping (our camels). We found the Prophet (ﷺ) standing on his riding-animal at Kura' al-Ghamim. When the people gathered near him, he recited: \"Verily We have granted thee a manifest victory. A man asked: Is this a victory, Messenger of Allah? He replied: Yes. By Him in Whose hands the soul of Muhammad is, this is a victory. Khaybar was divided among those who had been at al-Hudaybiyyah, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) divided it into eighteen portions. The army consisted of one thousand five hundred men, of which three hundred were cavalry, and he gave two shares to a horseman and one to a foot-soldier. Abu Dawud said: Abu Mu'awiyah's tradition is sounder, and it is one which is followed. I think the error is in the tradition of Mujammi', because he said: \"three hundred horsemen.\" when there were only two hundred",
