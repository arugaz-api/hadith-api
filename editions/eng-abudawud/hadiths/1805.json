    "text": "‘Abd Allah bin Umar said At the Farewell Pilgrimage the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) put on ihram first for ‘Umrah and afterwards for Hajj and drove the sacrificial animals along with him from Dhu Al Hulaifah. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) first raised his voice in talbiyah for ‘Umrah and afterwards he did so for Hajj; and the people along with the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did it first for ‘Umrah and afterwards for Hajj. Some of the people had brought sacrificial animals and others had not, so when the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) came to Makkah , he said to the people. Those of you who have brought sacrificial animals must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for you till you complete your Hajj; but those of you who have not brought sacrificial animals should go round the House(Ka’bah) and run between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah, clip their hair, put off ihram, and afterwards raise their voice in talbiyah for Hajj and bring sacrificial animals. Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during Hajj and seven days when they return to their families. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then performed circumambulation when he came to Makkah first touching the corner then running during three circuits out of seven and walking during four and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House (Ka’bah) he prayed two rak’ahs at Maqam Ibrahim, then giving the salutation and departing he went to Al Safa’ and ran seven times between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful for him till he had completed his Hajj, sacrificed his animals on the day of sacrifice, went quickly and performed the circumambulation of the House(the Ka’bah), after which all that had been unlawful became lawful for him. Those people who had brought sacrificial animals did as the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did",
