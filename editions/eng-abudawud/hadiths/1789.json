    "text": "Jabir bin Abdullah said The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and his companions raised their voices in talbiyah for Hajj. No one of them had brought the sacrificial animals with them except the Prophet(ﷺ) and Talhah. Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) had returned from Yemen and had brought sacrificial animals with him. He said I raised my voice in talbiyah for which the Apostle of Allaah (ﷺ) raised his voice. The Prophet (ﷺ) commanded his companions to change it into ‘Umrah and clip their hair after running (between Al Safa’ and Al Marwah), and then take off their ihram except those who brought the sacrificial animals with them. They remarked should we go to Mina with our penises dripping with prostatic fluid? These remarks reached the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ). Thereupon he said “had I known before hand about my affair what I have come to know later, I would not have brought sacrificial animals. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have put off my ihram. “",
