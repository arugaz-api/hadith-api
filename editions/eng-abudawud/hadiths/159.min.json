Abu Dawud said: 'Abd al-Rahman b. Mahdi did not narrate this tradition because the familiar version from al-Mughirah says that the Prophet (ﷺ) wiped over the socks. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari has also reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) wiped over stockings. But the chain of narrators of this tradition is neither continous nor strong. 'Ali b. Abi Talib, Ibn Mas'ud, al-Bara' b. 'Aziz, Anas b. Malik, Abu Umamah, Sahl b. Sa'd and 'Amr b.
