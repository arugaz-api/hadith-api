He then narrated the tradition like the one narrated in (No.855). This version is as follows: The Prophet (ï·º) said: The prayer of anyone is not perfect unless he performs ablution perfectly; he should then utter the takbir, and praise Allah, the Exalted, and admire Him; he should then recite the Qur'an as much as he desires. He should then say: \"Allah is Most Great\". Next he should bow so that all his joints return to their proper places. Then he should say: \"Allah listens to the one who praises Him\", and stand erect. He should then say:\"Allah is most great,\" and should prostrate himself so that all his joints are completely at rest. Then he should say: \"Allah is most great\"; he should raise his head (at the end of prostration) till he sits erect. Then he should say: \"Allah is most great\"; then he should prostrate himself till all his joints return to their proper places. Then he should raise his head and say the takbir. When he does so, then his prayer is completed","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":467}}}
