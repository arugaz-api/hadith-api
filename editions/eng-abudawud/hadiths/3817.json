We said: Some food in the evening and some in the morning. AbuNu'aym said: Uqbah explained it to me saying: a cup (of milk) in the morning and a cup in the evening; this does not satisfy the hunger. So made the carrion lawful for them in this condition. Abu Dawud said: Ghabuq is a drink in the evening and Sabuh is a drink in the morning",
