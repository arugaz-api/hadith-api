    "text": "‘Ali bin al-Hussain said that when they returned to Madeenah from Yazid bin Mu’awiyah the place of massacre of Al Hussain bin Ali(may Allaah be pleased with him) Al Miswar bin Makhramah met them and said “tell me if you have any need for me. I said to him “No”. He then said Will you not give me the sword of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)? I fear the people may not take it from you by force. (He said) By Allaah if you give it to me no one can take it from me so long as I am alive. Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allaah be pleased with him) asked for the hand of Abu Jahl’s daughter in marriage after the marriage with Fathima. I heard the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) say while he was addressing the people about this matter on the pulpit and I was mature in those days. Fathima is from me and I am not afraid that she will be tried in respect of her religion. He then mentioned his other son-in-law who belonged to Banu ‘Abd Shams. He admired him immensely for his relationship with him and extolled him well. He said “He talked to me and talked truly and he made promise with me and fulfilled it. I do not make lawful what Is unlawful and unlawful what is lawful. But, by Allaah the daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and the daughter of the enemy of Allaah can never be combined together",
