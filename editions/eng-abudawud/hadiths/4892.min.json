I forbade them, but they did not stop. I then said to Uqbah ibn Amir: These neighbours of ours drink wine, and I tried to prevent them but they did not stop, and I am going to call the police about them. He said: Leave them. I again came to Uqbah ibn Amir and said: Our neighbours have refused to refrain from drinking wine, and I am going to call the police for them. He said: Woe to thee! Leave them alone. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) say: he then mentioned the tradition to the same effect as recorded above on the authority of the narrator Muslim. Abu Dawud said: In this version Hashim b. al-Qasim said on the authority of Laith: Do not do it, but preach them and threaten them","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan Lighairihi"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":120}}}
