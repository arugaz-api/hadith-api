He was asked: What constitutes affluence, Messenger of Allah? He replied:It is fifty dirhams or its value in gold. The narrator Yahya said: Abdullah ibn Sufyan said to Sufyan: I remember that Shu'bah does not narrate from Hakim ibn Jubayr. Sufyan said: Zubayr transmitted to us this tradition from Muhammad ibn AbdurRahman ibn Yazid",
