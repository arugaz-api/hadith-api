    "text": "Narrated AbuBakrah: AbdurRahman ibn AbuBakrah said that he told his father: O my father! I hear you supplicating every morning: \"O Allah! Grant me health in my body. O Allah! Grant me good hearing. O Allah! Grant me good eyesight. There is no god but Thou.\" You repeat them three times in the morning and three times in the evening. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) using these words as a supplication and I like to follow his practice. The transmitter, Abbas, said in this version: And you say: \"O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from infidelity and poverty. O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from punishment in the grave. There is no god but Thee\". You repeat them three times in the morning and three times in the evening, and use them as a supplication. I like to follow his practice. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The supplications to be used by one who is distressed are: \"O Allah! Thy mercy is what I hope for. Do not abandon me to myself for an instant, but put all my affairs in good order for me. There is no god but Thou.\" Some transmitters added more than others",
