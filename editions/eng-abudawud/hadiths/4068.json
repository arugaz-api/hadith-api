He asked: What is this? So I went and burnt it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: What have you done with your garment? I replied: I burnt it. He said: Why did you not give it to one of your women to wear? Abu Dawud said: Thawr transmitted it from Khalid and said: \"Pink (muwarrad)\" while Tawus said: \"Reddish yellow colour (mu'asfar)",
