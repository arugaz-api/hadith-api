    "text": "Abd al-Rahman b. 'Abis said:A man asked Ibb 'Abbas: Have you been present along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ? He replied: Yes. Had there been no dignity for me in his eyes, I would not have been present with him due to my minority. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to the point that was near the house of Kathir b. al-Salt. He prayed and afterwards preached. He (Ibn 'Abbas) did not mention the adhan (call to prayer) and the iqamah. He then commanded to give alms. The women began to point to their ears and throats (to give their jewelry in alms)",
