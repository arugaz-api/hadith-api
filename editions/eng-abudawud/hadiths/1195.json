I, therefore , threw them (the arrows) away and said: I must see how the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) acts in a solar eclipse today. So I came to him; he was standing (in prayer) raising his hands, glorifying Allah, praising Him, acknowledging that He is the only Deity, and making supplication till the sun was clear. He then recited two surahs and prayed two rak'ahs",
