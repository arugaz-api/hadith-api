Fatimah asked him to give it to her, but he refused. That is how matters stood during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) till he passed on (i.e. died). When AbuBakr was made ruler he administered it as the Prophet (ﷺ) had done in his lifetime till he passed on. Then when Umar ibn al-Khattab was made ruler he administered it as they had done till he passed on. Then it was given to Marwan as a fief, and it afterwards came to Umar ibn AbdulAziz. Umar ibn AbdulAziz said: I consider I have no right to something which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) refused to Fatimah, and I call you to witness that I have restored it to its former condition; meaning in the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Abu Dawud said: When 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz was made caliph its revenue was forty thousand dinars, and when he died its revenue was four hundred dinars. Had he remained alive, it would have been less than it","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":45}}}
