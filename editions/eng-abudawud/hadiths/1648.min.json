Abu Dawud said : The version of this tradition narrated by Ayyub from Nafi is disputed. The narrator `Abd al-Warith said in his version : `The upper hand is the one which abstains from begging;” but most of the narrators have narrated from Hammad b. Zaid from Ayyub the words “ The upper hand is the one which bestows.” A narrator from Hammad said in his version “the one which abstains from begging.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Shadh"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Shadh"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (1429) Sahih Muslim (1033)"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":93}}}
