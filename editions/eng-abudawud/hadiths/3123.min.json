When we had finished, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned and we also returned with him. When he approached his door, he stopped, and we saw a woman coming towards him. He (the narrator) said: I think he recognized her. When she went away, we came to know that she was Fatimah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: What brought you out of your house, Fatimah? She replied: I came to the people of this house, Messenger of Allah, and I showed pity and expressed my condolences to them for their deceased relation. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You might have gone to the graveyard with them. She replied: I seek refuge in Allah! I heard you referring to what you mentioned. He said: If you had gone to the graveyard...He then mentioned severe words about it. I then asked Rabi'ah (a narrator of this tradition) about al-kuda (stony land).
