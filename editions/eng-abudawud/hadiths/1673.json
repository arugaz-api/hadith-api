    "text": "Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansari: While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) a man brought him some gold equal in weight to an egg, and said: Messenger of Allah, I have got this from a mine; take it; it is sadaqah. I have no more than this. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned his attention from him. Then he came to him from his right side and repeated the same words. But he (the Prophet) turned his attention from him. He then came to him from his left side and repeated the same words. But he (again) turned his attention from him. He then came to him from behind. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took it and threw it away. Had it hit him, it would have hurt him or wounded him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: One of you brings all that he possesses and says: This is sadaqah. Then he sits down and spreads his hand before the people. The best sadaqah is that which leaves a competence",
