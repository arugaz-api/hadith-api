He stood at the door and gave the salutation to us and we returned it (the salutation) to him. Thereupon, he said: I am the messenger of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to you. He commanded us to bring out the menstruating women and the virgins for both the 'Id prayers, and that the Friday prayer is not obligatory on us. He prohibited us to accompany the funeral procession",
