Ibn 'Ubaid in his version said: The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: If anyone is killed in error (blindly) when people are throwing stones, or by beating with whips, or striking with a stick, it is accidental and the compensation for accidental death is due. But if anyone is killed deliberately, retaliation is due. Ibn 'Ubaid in his version: Retaliation of the man is due. The agreed version then goes: If anyone comes in (between the two parties) to prevent it, Allah's curse and anger will rest on him, and neither supererogatory nor obligatory acts will be accepted from him.
