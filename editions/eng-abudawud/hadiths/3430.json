    "text": "AbuMajidah said:I cut the ear of a boy, or he cut my ear (the narrator is doubtful). AbuBakr then came to us to perform hajj and we got together with him. But he referred us to Umar ibn al-Khattab. Umar (ibn al-Khattab) said: This reached the extent of retaliation. Call a cupper to me so that he may retaliate. When the cupper was called, he (Umar) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) say: I gave a boy to my maternal aunt, and I hope that she will be blessed in respect of him. I said to her: Do not entrust him to a supper, nor to a goldsmith, nor to a butcher. Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by 'Abd al-A'la from Ibn Ishaq who said: Abu Majidah is a man of Banu Sahm narrating from 'Umar b. al-Khattab",
