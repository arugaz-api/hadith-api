    "text": "Narrated Usamah b. Zaid:I said: Messenger of Allah, where will you stay tomorrow ? This (happened) during his Hajj. He replied: Has 'Aqil left any house for us ? He then said: We shall stay at the valley of Banu Kinarah where the Quraish took an oath on unbelief. This refers to al-Muhassab. The reason is that Banu Kinarah made an alliance with the Quraish against Banu Hashim that they would have no marital connections with them, nor will have commercial transactions with them, not will give them any refuge. Al-Zuhri said: Khalf means valley",
