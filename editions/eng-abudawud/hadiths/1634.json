The version of Shu'bah from Sa'd has: \"for a man who has strength and is robust.\" The other version of this tradition from the Prophet (ﷺ) have the words \"for a man who has strength and is robust.\" Others have \"for a man who has strength and is sound in limbs.\" 'Ata bin Zuhair said that he had met 'Abd Allah bin 'Amr who said: \"Sadaqah is not lawful for a strong man nor for a man who has strength and is sound in limbs",
