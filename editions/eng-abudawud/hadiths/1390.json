He replied: In one month. He said: I am more energetic to complete it in a period less than this. He kept on repeating these words and lessening the period until he said: Complete its recitation in seven days. He again said: I am more energetic to complete it in a period less than this. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: He who finishes the recitation of the Qur'an in less than three days does not understand it",
