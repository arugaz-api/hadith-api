    "text": "Sahl bin Sa’ad said “The version of Musaddad has “I witnessed the invoking of curses by the two spouses during the life time of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) when I was fifteen years old. When they finished invoking curses, the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) separated them from each other. Here ends the version of Musaddad. Others said “He was present when the Prophet (ﷺ) separated the spouses who invoked curses on each other. The man (Sahl) said “I shall have lied against her, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) if I keep her. Abu Dawud said “Some narrators did not mention the word ‘alaiha(against her).” Abu Dawud said “No one supported Ibn ‘Uyainah that he separated the spouses who invoked curses.”",
