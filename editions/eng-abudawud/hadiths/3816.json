    "text": "Narrated Jabir ibn Samurah: A man alighted at Harrah with his wife and children. A man said (to him): My she-camel has strayed; if you find it, detain it. He found it, but did not find its owner, and it fell ill. His wife said: Slaughter it. But he refused and it died. She said: Skin it so that we may dry its fat and flesh and then eat them. He said: Let me ask the Messenger of Allah (ï·º). So he came to him (the Prophet) and asked him. He said: Have you sufficient for your needs? He replied: No. He then said: Then eat it. Then its owner came and he told him the story. He said: Why did you not slaughter it? He replied: I was ashamed (or afraid) of you",
