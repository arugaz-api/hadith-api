    "text": "Narrated AbuAbdurRahman al-Fihri: I was present with the Messenger of Allah at the battle of Hunayn. We travelled on a hot day when the heat was extreme. We halted under the shade of a tree. When the sun passed the meridian, I put on my coat of mail and rode on my horse. I came to the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) who was in a tent. I said: Peace, Allah's mercy and His blessings be upon you! The time of departure has come. He said: Yes. He then said: Rise, Bilal. He jumped out from beneath a gum-acacia tree and its shade was like that of a bird. He said: I am at your service and at your pleasure, and I make myself a sacrifice for you. He said: Put the saddle on the horse for me. He then took out a saddle, both sides of which were stuffed with palm-leaves; it showed no arrogance and pride. So he rode and we also rode. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. Abu Dawud said: Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri did not transmit any tradition except this one. This is a tradition of an expert transmitted by Hammad b. Salamah",
