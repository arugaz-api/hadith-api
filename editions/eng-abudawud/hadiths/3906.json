They said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He said: This morning there were among mt servants one who believes in me and one who disbelieves. The one who said: \"We have been given rain by Allah's grace and mercy\" is the one who believes in me and disbelieves in the star ; but the one who said: \"We have been given rain by such and such a rain star,\" is the one who disbelieves in me and believes in the star",
