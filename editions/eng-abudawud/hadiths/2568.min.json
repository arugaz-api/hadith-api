As for the Camels of the devils, I have seen them. One of you goes out with his side Camels which he has fattened neither riding any of them nor giving a lift to a tired brother when he meets. As regard the houses of the devils, I have not seen them. The narrator Sa’id says “I think they are those cages (Camel litters) which conceal people with brocade.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":92}}}
