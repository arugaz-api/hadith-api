Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather reported The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said:A woman who marries on a dower or a reward or a promise before the solemnisation of marriage is entitled to it; and whatever is fixed for her after solemnisation of marriage belongs to whom it is given.
