    "text": "Narrated Ibn Umar: I bought olive oil in the market. When I became its owner, a man met me and offered good profit for it. I intended to settle the bargain with him, but a man caught hold of my hand from behind. When I turned I found that he was Zayd ibn Thabit. He said: Do not sell it on the spot where you have bought it until you take it to your house, for the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) forbade to sell the goods where they are bought until the tradesmen take them to their houses",
