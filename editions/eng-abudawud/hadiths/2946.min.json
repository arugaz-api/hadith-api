{"author":"Sunan Abu Dawud","hadith":{"hadithnumber":2946,"arabicnumber":2946,"text":"Narrated Abu Humaid al-Sa'idi:The Prophet (ﷺ) appointed a man of Azd called Ibn al-Lutbiyayah (to collect sadaqah). The narrator Ibn al-Sarh said: (He appointed) Ibn al-Utbiyyah to collect the sadaqah. When he returned he said: This is for you and this was given to me as present. So the Prophet (ﷺ) stood on the pulpit, and after praising and extolling Allah he said: What is the matter with a collector of sadaqah. We send him (to collect sadaqah), and when he return he says: This is for you and this is a present which was given to me. Why did he not sit in his father's or mother's house and see whether it would be given to him or not ? Whoever takes any of it will inevitably bring it on the Day of Resurrection, be it a camel which rumbles, an ox which bellows, or sheep which-bleats. Then raising his arms so that we could see where the hair grow under his armpits, he said: O Allah, have I given full information ? O Allah, have I given full information ?","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (7174) Sahih Muslim (1832)"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":19}}}
