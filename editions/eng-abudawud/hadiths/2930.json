    "text": "Narrated Abu Musa:I went along with two men to see the Prophet (ﷺ). One of them recited tashahhud and said: We have come to you so that you may employ us for your work. The other also said the same thing. He (the Prophet) replied: The most faithless of you in our eyes is the one who asked for it (responsible post). Abu Musa then apologized to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: I did not know why they came to you. He did not employ them for anything until he died",
