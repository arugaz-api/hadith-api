    "text": "Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) did not prescribe any punishment for drinking wine. Ibn Abbas said: A man who had drunk wine and become intoxicated was found staggering on the road, so he was taken to the Prophet (ﷺ). When he was opposite al-Abbas's house, he escaped, and going in to al-Abbas, he grasped hold of him. When that was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ), he laughed and said: Did he do that? and he gave no command regarding him. Abu Dawud said: This tradition of al-Hasan b. 'Ali has been transmitted only by the people of Medina",
