    "text": "Abu Al-Aliyah narrated:“The Prophet mentioned their (the idolater’s) gods, so they said: ‘Then name your Lord’s lineage for us.’” He said: “So Jibril, peace be upon him, came to him with this Surat: Say: “He is Allah, the One.” So he mentioned similarly, but he did not say in it: “From Ubayy bin Ka’b.” And this is more correct than the narration of Abu Sa’eed (no. 3364). Abu Sa’eed’s name is Muhammad bin Muyassar",
