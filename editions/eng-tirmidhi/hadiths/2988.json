    "text": "Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud:that the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: \"Indeed the Shaitan has an effect on the son of Adam, and the angel also has en effect. As for the Shaitan, it is by threatening evil repercussions and rejecting the truth. As for the effect of the angel, it is by his promise of a good end and believing in the truth. Whoever finds that, let him know that it is from Allah, and let him praise Allah for it. Whoever finds the other then let him seek refuge with Allah from the Shaitan (the outcast) then recite: Shaitan threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit Fahisha (2:)",
