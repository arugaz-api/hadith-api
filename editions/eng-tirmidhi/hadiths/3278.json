    "text": "Narrated Ash-Sha'bi:\"Ibn 'Abbas met Ka'b at Arafat, so he asked him about something and he kept on saying the Takbir until it reverberated off of the mountains. So Ibn 'Abbas (finally) said: 'We are Banu Hashim.' So Ka'b said: 'Indeed Allah divided His being seen and His speaking between Muhammad and Musa. He spoke to Musa two times, and Muhammad saw Him two times.' Masruq said: 'I entered upon 'Aishah and asked her if Muhammad saw his Lord.' She said: 'You have said something that makes my hair stand on end.' I said: 'Take it easy.' Then I recited: Indeed he saw of the great signs of his Lord (53:18). So she said: 'What do you mean by that? That is only Jibra'il. Whoever informed you that Muhammad saw his Lord, or that (ﷺ) concealed something he was ordered with, or he knew of the five things about which Allah, [Most High] said: Verily Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain (31:34) - then he has fabricated the worst lie. Rather he (ﷺ) saw Jibra'il, but he did not see him in his (real) image except two times. One time at Sidrat Al-Muntaha and one time in Jiyad, he had six-hundred wings which filled the horizon",
