    "text": "Narrated Zirr bin Hubaish:\"I said to Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman: 'Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) perform Salat in Bait Al-Maqdis?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'But he did.' He said: 'You say that, O bald one! Based upon what do you say that?' I said: 'Based upon the Qur'an, (the Judge) between you and I is the Qur'an.'

He (Hudhaifah) said: 'Do you see (this proves that) he (ﷺ) performed Salat in it?' I said: 'No.' He said: 'If he had performed Salat in it, then it would have been required upon you that you perform Salat in it, just as it is required that you perform Salat in Al-Masjid Al-Haram.' Hudhaifah said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was brought a beast with a long back - stretching out like this - one stride of it, is as far as his vision. So, the two of them remained upon the back of Al-Buraq until they saw Paradise and the Fire, and all of what has been prepared for the Hereafter, then they returned back to where they began.' He said: 'They say that he was fettered, but for what? Because he might flee? The Knower of the unseen and the witness subdued him",
