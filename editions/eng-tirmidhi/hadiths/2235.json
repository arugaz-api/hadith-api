    "text": "Az-Zuhri narrated from Salim from Ibn 'Umar who said:\"The Messengers of Allah(s.a.w)stood among the people,he praised Allah as is due to Him, then he mentioned the Dajjal and he said: 'Indeed I warn you of him. There has not been a Prophet except that he warned his people, and Nuh indeed warned his people – but I am to say something about him that no Prophet has said to his people: You should know that he is one-eyed, and Allah is certainly not one-eyed.'” Az-Zuhri said: “ `Umar bin Thabit Al-Ansari informed me that some of the Companions of the Prophet(s.a.w) informed him, that one day, the Prophet(s.a.w) was cautioning them against Fitnah and he said: 'You must know that not one of you will ever see his Lord until he dies. And indeed, he(the Dajjal) has “Kafir” written between his eyes; everyone who is averse to his behavior shall read it.'” (Sahih)",
