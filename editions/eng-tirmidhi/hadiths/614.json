    "text": "Ka'b bin Ujrah narrated:\"The Messenger of Allah said to me: 'I seek refuge in Allah for you O Ka'b bin Ujrah from leader that will be after me. Whoever comes to their doors to approve of their lies and supports them in their oppression, then he is not of me and I am not of him, and he will not meet me at the Hawd. And whoever comes to their doors, or he does not come, and he does not approve of their lies and he does not support them in their oppression, then he is from me and I am from him, and he will meet me at the Hawd. Ka'ab bin Ujrah! Salat is clear proof, and Sawm (fasting) is an impregnable shield, and Sadaqah (charity) extinguishes sins just as water extinguishes fire. O Ka'b bin Ujrah! There is no flesh raised that sprouts from the unlawful except that the Fire is more appropriate for it",
