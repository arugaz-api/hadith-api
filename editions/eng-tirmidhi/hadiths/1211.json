For they have indeed failed and are lost!\" He sai: \"The Mannan, the one whose Izar hangs (below the ankels) and the one who promotes his merchandise with false oath.\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from Ibn Mas'ud, Abu Hurairah, Abu Umamah bin Tha'labah, 'Imran bin Husain, and Ma'qil bin Yasar [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Abu Dharr is a Hasan Sahih Hadith",
