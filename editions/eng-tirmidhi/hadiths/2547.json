They said:'Yes.' He said: 'Would you be pleased to be a third of the people of Paradise?' They said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Would you be pleased to be one half of the people of Paradise? Verily none shall enter Paradise except a Muslim soul. And you are not with relation to Shirk except like the white hair on the hide of a black bull or like the black hair on the hide of a red bull.\" Other chains report similar narrations",
