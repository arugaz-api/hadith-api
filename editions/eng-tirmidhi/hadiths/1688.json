I did not flee from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but som hasty people fled and (the tribe of) Hawazin assaulted them with arrows.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was saying: 'I am the Prophet without lie, I am the son of 'Abdul-Muttalib.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There are narrations on this topic from 'Ali, and Ibn 'Umar",
