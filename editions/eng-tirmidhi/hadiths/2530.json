    "text": "Mu'adh bin Jabal narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\"Whoever fasts Ramadan, performs the Salat, performs Hajj to the House\" - I do not know whether he mentioned Zakat or not - \"except that it is binding on Allah that He forgive him, whether he emigrated in the cause of Allah, or remained in his land in which he was born.\" Mu'adh said: \"Should I not inform the people of this?\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Leave the people to do deeds, for verily in Paradise there are a hundred levels, what is between every two levels is like what is between the heavens and the earth. Al-Firdaus is the highest of Paradise and its most expansive, and above that is the Throne of Ar-Rahman (the Most Merciful), and from it the rivers of Paradise are made to flow forth. So when you ask Allah, ask Him for Al-Firdaus",
