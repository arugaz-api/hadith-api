The Messenger of Allah said: 'Do not wear shirts, nor pants, nor burnooses, nor turbans, nor Khuff - unless one does not have any sandals, then let him wear Khuff, but let him cut them below the ankles. And do not wear any cloth that has been touched by saffron or Wars. And the woman in Ihram is not to cover her face, nor wear gloves",
