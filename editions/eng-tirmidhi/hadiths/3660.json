So he chose what is with Him.' So Abu Bakr said: 'We will ransom our fathers and mothers for you O Messenger of Allah!'\" He said: \"So we were amazed. Then the people said: 'Look at this old man. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) informs about a worshiper whom Allah gave the choice, between Him giving him from the bounty of this life as much as he wishes, and between that which is with Allah, and he says: 'We will ransom our fathers and mothers for you?' But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was the one given the choice, and Abu Bakr was the most knowledgeable of it among them. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'From those who were most beneficial to me among the people in their companionship and their wealth was Abu Bakr. And if I were to take a Khalil, I would would have taken Abu Bakr as a Khalil. But rather, the brotherhood of Islam. Let there not remain a door in the Masjid except the door of Abu Bakr",
