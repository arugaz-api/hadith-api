He had promised a man from the captives of Makkah that he would transport him, and he said: 'So I came until I reached one of the walls of Makkah on a moon-lit night.' He said \"'Anaq came along and she saw the darkness of my shadow next to the wall. When she reached me she recognized me and said: \"Marthad?\" So I replied: \"(Yes it is) Marthad.\" She said: \"Welcome, come and spend the night with us.\" I said: \"O 'Anaq! Allah has made illicit sexual relations unlawful.\" So she said: \"O people of the tents! That is the man who takes your captives away!\" He said: \"Eight people followed me, and I went through the passes of Al-Khandamah. I stopped at a cave and entered it. They came until they stood over my head, and they began urinating, their urine falling on my head. Yet Allah made them unable to see me. He said: 'Then I went back. I returned to my companion to transport him - and he was a heavy man - until I reached Al-Idhkir. There I removed his shackles to make him easier to carry, since he was exhausting me, until I arrived at Al-Madinah. I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I said \"O Messenger of Allah! May I marry 'Anaq? [I said this, two times] but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was silent, and he did not reply to me at all until (the following) was revealed: The Zani marries not but a Zaniyah or a Mushrikah; and the Zaniyah, none marries her except a Zani or a Mushrik (24:3). So do not marry her","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":229}}}
