What is wrong with us that when we are with you our hearts are softened and we feel free of desire for this world, and we are of the people of the Hereafter. But when we depart from you and socialize with our families and our children, we do not recognize ourselves(i.e., we are changed persons)?' So the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'If you were to be in that condition when you depart from me, the angels would have surely visited you in your houses. And if you did not sin, Allah would surely have brought anew creation that they may sin, so that then He may forgive them.'\"He said: \"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! From what was the creation created?' He said: 'From water.' We said: 'Paradise, what is it constructed of?' He said,'Bricks of silver and bricks of gold. Its mortar is musk of a strong fragrance, and its pebbles are pearls and rubies, and its earth is saffron. Whoever enters it shall live and shall not suffer, and shall feel joy and shall not die, nor shall their clothes wear out, nor shall their youth come to an end.' Then he said: 'Three persons , their supplication is not rejected: The just ruler, the fasting person when he breaks his fast, and the supplication of the wronged person. It is raised up above the clouds, and the gates of Heaven are opened up for it, and the Lord, Blessed and Exalted says: I shall surely come to your aid, even if after a time","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":38,"hadith":4}}}
