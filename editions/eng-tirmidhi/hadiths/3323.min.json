The Messenger of Allah went out with a group of his Companions towards the Ukaz market. Something had been intervening between the Shayatin and the news from the heavens, and shooting stars has been sent upon them, so the Shayatin returned to their people and they said to them: ‘What is wrong with you?’ They replied: ‘Something has been intervening between us and the news of the heavens except that something has happened. So travel east and west in the earth and look for what is it that intervenes between you an between the news of the heavens.’” He said: “So they went traveling east and west on the earth, seeking whatever it was that had been intervening between them and the news of the heavens.

He was performing Salat Al-Fajr with his Companions. When they heard the Quran they listened to it, and they said: ‘By Allah! This is what has been intervening between us and the news of the heavens.’” He said: “Then they returned to their people and said: ‘O our people! Verily we heard a wonderful Recitation! It guides to the Right Path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join anything with our Lord.’ So Allah, Blessed is He and Most High, revealed to His Prophet: Say: ‘It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened.’ So the saying of the jinns was only revealed to him.” [He said:] With this chain, from Ibn 'Abbas, who said: \"The jinns said to their people: When the worshipper stood up invoking Him in prayer, they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.\" He said: \"When they saw him performing Salat, and his Companions were performing Salãt, and they were prostrating along with his prostrations.\" He said: \"They were amazed at how his Companions obeyed him so they said to their people: When the worshipper stood up invoking Him in prayer, they just made round Him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":375}}}
