    "text": "Abu Salih reported from Abu Hurairah and Abu Sa'eed that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said:\"The servant will be brought on the Day of Judgement, and He will say to hi: 'Did I not give you hearing, sight, wealth, children, and did I not make the cattle and tillage subservient to you, and did I not leave you as the head of people taking from their wealth? Did you not think that you would have to meet with Me on this Day of yours?' So he will say: 'No.' So it will be said to him: 'Today you shall be forgotten just as you have forgotten Me.'\" [Ab√º 'Elsa said:] This Hadith is Sahih Gharib and the meaning of His saying: \"Today you shall be forgotten just as you have forgotten Me\" is: Today I shall leave you in chastisement. [This is how they have explained it]. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This is how some of the people of knowledge have explained this Ayah: So this Day We shall forget them...They said that it means: We shall leave them in chastisement",
