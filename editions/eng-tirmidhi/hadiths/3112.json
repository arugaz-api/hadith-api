    "text": "Narrated 'Abdullah:\"A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: 'I fondled a woman who lives on the edge of Al-Madinah, and I did with her what is less than intercourse, and here I am, so judge in my case as you will.' So 'Umar said to him: 'Allah covered you, so you should have covered yourself.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give him any reply. The man left but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a man after him to call him. He recited to him: 'And perform Salat, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful (11:114) until the end of the Ayah. A man among the people said: 'Is this specific for him?' He (ﷺ) said: 'No. Rather for all of the people.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. This is how it was reported by Isra'Il from Simãk, from Ibrahim, from 'Alqamah and Al-Aswad, from 'Abdullãh from the Prophet , and it is similar. Shu'bah reported it from Simãk [bin Harb], from Ibrahim, from AlAswad, from 'Abdullãh from the Prophet similarly. Sufyan AthThawri reported the same from Simãk, from Ibrahim, 'AbdurRahman bin Yazld, from 'Abdulläh from the Prophet (ﷺ). And the narrations of these people are more correct than the narration of Ath-Thawri. (Another chain) from 'Abdullãh from the Prophet with similar. (Another chain) from 'Abdulläh bin Mas'üd from the Prophet (ﷺ) with similar in meaning, but he did not mention \"from Al-A'mash\" in it. And Sulaimãn At-Taimi reported this Hadith from Abu 'Uthmãn An-Nahdi, from Ibn Mas'ud from the Prophet",
