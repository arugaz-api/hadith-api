Then Abu Bakr came to him. So he said:\"What brought you O Abu Bakr?\" He said: \"I came to meet the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) and to look at his face, and to make sure he was safe. It was not long before 'Umar came. He said: \"What has brought you O 'Umar ?\" He said: \"Hunger O Messenger of Allah!\"He said: \"I also experienced some of that\" So they went to the home of Abu Al-Haitham At-Taiyyihan Al-Ansari. He was a man with many date-palms and sheep, but he had no servants so they did not find him there. They said to his wife: \"Where is your companion?\" She said: \"He has gone to fetch us some good water.\" It was not long before Abu Al-Haitham came along hauling to a large water-skin which he put down. Then he came to hug the Prophet (s.a.w) and uttered that his father and mother should be ransomed for him. Then he went to grove of his and he spread out a mat for them. Then he went to a date-palm and returned with a cluster of dates which he put down. The prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Why don't you select some ripe dates for us?\" He said: \"O Messenger of Allah(s.a.w)! I wanted you to select from the ripe dates and the unripe dates.\" So they ate and they drank from that water. The Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! This is among the favors which you shall be asked about on the Day of Judgement. Cool shade, tasty ripe dates, and cool water.\" Abu Al-Haitham left to prepare some food for them. The Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Do not slaughter one with milk.\" So he Slaughtered a small female or male goat and brought it to them so they could eat it. The Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Do you have any servants?\" He said: \"No.\" So he said: \"Then if we get some captives we shall bring them for you.\" So (later) the Prophet (s.a.w) came with 2 males, there was no third among them and he brought them to Abu Al-Haitham. The Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Choose from them.\" He said: \"O Prophet of Allah! Choose for me.\" So the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Indeed the one consulted is entrusted. Take this one for I have seen him praying, and encourage him to do well.\" So Abu Al-Haitham went to his wife and informed her of what the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said. So his wife said: \"You will not fulfill what the Prophet (s.a.w) said until you have freed him.\" So he said: \"He is free.\" So the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Indeed Allah has not send a Prophet nor made a Khalifah except that he has two groups of supporters, group ordering him to do good, and prohibiting him from evil and a group that never ceases spoiling his affairs.
