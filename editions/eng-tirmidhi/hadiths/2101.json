He said to her, 'There is noting for you in the Book of Allah and there is nothing for you in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah(S.A.W). So ,return until I ask the people. So he asked the people and Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah said: 'I was present when the Messenger of Allah(S.A.W) gave her (case) a sixth.' So he said: 'Was anyone else with you?' Muhammad bin Maslamah stood to say the same as what Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah said. So Abu Bakr implemented that for her.\" Then the other grandmother came to 'Umar bin Al-Khattab to ask him about her inheritance. He said: 'There is nothing in the Book of Allah for you, but there is that sixth. So if the two of you are together then it is for both of you, and whichever of you remains), then it is for her",
