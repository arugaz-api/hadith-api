    "text": "Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: \"The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) was a slave (of Allah), who would order as he has ben ordered to. He did not give an order to us instead of the people regarding anything except for three: He ordered us that we make our Wudu' well (Isbagh), that we not eat from charity, and the we not mate a donkey with a horse.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There is something on this topic from 'Ali. This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported this from Abu Jahdam, who said: \"From 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, from Ibn 'Abbas.\" He said I heard Muhammad saying: \"The narration of Ath-Thawri is not preserved. Ath-Thawri made a mistake in it. What is correct is what Ismail bin 'Ulaiyyah and 'Abul-Warith bin Sa'eed reported from Abu Jahdam, from 'Abdullah bin 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abbas from Ibn 'Abbas",
