    "text": "Zainab bint Ka'b bin Ujrah narrated that :Al-Furay'ah bint Malik bin Sinan - the sister of the Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri - informed her that she went to the Messenger of Allah to ask him if she could return to her family in Banu Khudrah. Her husband had gone out searching for his runaway slaves, and when he was in Turaf Al-Qadum he caught up with them and they killed him. She said: \"So I asked the Messenger of Allah if I could return to my family since my husband had not left me a home that he owned nor any maintenance.\" She said: \"So the Messenger of Allah said: 'Yes.' Then I left. When I was in the courtyard,\" or, \"in the Masjid, the Messenger of Allah called me\" or, \"summoned for me to come back t him and he said: 'What did you say?'\" She said: \"So I repeated the store that I had mentioned to him about the case of my husband. He said: 'Stay in your house until what is written reaches its term.'\" She said: \"So I observed my Iddah there for four months and ten (days).\" She said: \"During the time of Uthman, he sent a message to me asking me about that, so I informed him. He followed it and judged accordingly",
