When he completed the Salat he said: \"The Imam is appointed to be followed; when he says the Takbir then say the Takbir, when he bows, then bow, and when he raises his head, then raise your heads. When he says: \"Sami' Allahu liman hamidah (Allah listens to those who praise him)\" then say: \"Rabbana wa lakal-hamd. (O our Lord! And all praise is Yours.)\" and when he prostrates, then prostrate, and when he performs Salat sitting, then pray sitting altogether","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":213}}}
