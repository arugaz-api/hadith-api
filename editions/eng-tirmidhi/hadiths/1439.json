He recited to them the Ayah. (And he said:)'Whoever among you dies, then this reward is with Allah, and whoever among you does some of this and then he is punished, it is atonement for him. And whoever does some of this and Allah covers it for him, then it is up to Allah; if He wills, He will punish them, and if He wills, He will forgive him",
