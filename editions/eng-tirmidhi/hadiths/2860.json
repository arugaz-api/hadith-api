    "text": "Narrated Sa'eed bin Hilal:that Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari said: \"One day the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) came out to us and said: \"While I was sleeping I had a vision as if Jibra'il was at my feet. One of them said to his companion: 'Make a parable for him' so he said: 'Listen so that your ears may hear. Hearken so that your heart may understand! The parable of you and your Ummah is but the parable of a king who conquers a land, then he constructs a house in it. Then he places a table-spread in it, then he sends a messenger to call the people to eat from it. Among them are those who answer the call of the messenger, and among them are those who forsake it. So Allah is the king and the land is Islam, and the house is Paradise, and you O Muhammad! You are the Messenger, so whoever responds to you he enters Islam, and whoever enters Islam he enters Paradise, and whoever enters Paradise, he shall eat of what is in it",
