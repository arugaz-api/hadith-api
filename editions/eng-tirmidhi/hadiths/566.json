So he narrated it to me from Shu'bah, from Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim, from his father, from Salih bin Khawwat, from Sahl bin Abi Hathmah, from the Prophet - the same as the Hadith of Yahya bin Sa'eed Al-Ansari. And he (Yahya) said to me: \"Write it next to it. He did not memorize the Hadith better though, rather it is the same Hadith as that of Yahya bin Sa'eed Al-Ansari'\" (a Hadith similar to no. 565, with a different chain of narrators)",
