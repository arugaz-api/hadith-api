    "text": "Ibn Abbas narrated:“I entered with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I and Khalid bin Al-Walid, upon Maimunah so she brought us a vessel of milk. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) drank from it. I was upon his right and Khalid was upon left, so he said to me: ‘The (turn to) drink is for you, so if you wish, you could choose to grant it to Khalid.’ So I said: ‘I would not prefer anyone (above myself) for your leftovers.’ Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever Allah feeds some food, then let him say: “O Allah, bless it for us, and feed us better than it, (Allāhumma bārik lanā fīhi wa aṭ`imnā khairan minhu)” and whomsoever Allah gives milk to drink, then let him say: “O Allah bless it for us, and grant us increase in it (Allāhumma bārik lanā fīhi wa zidnā minhu).” And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ‘There is nothing that suffices in the place of food and drink except for milk.’”",
