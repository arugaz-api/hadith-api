If we return to Al-Madinah then the more honorable will expel the meaner among them. So I mentioned that to my uncle, then my uncle mentioned it to the Prophet. So the Prophet called for me to narrated it to him. Then the Messenger of Allah sent message to Abdullah bin Ubayy and his companions but they took an oath that they had not said it. So he did not believe me and he trusted what they said. I was struck with distress the likes of which I had not suffered before. So I just at in my house, and my uncle said to me: ‘You only wanted the Messenger of Allah to not believe you and hate you.’ Then Allah [Most High] revealed: ‘When the hypocrites come to you’ So the Messenger of Allah sent for me, and he recites it and said: ‘Indeed Allah has verified the truth of what you said.’”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":364}}}
