The next day, what he saw him doing would not prevent him from eating with him, drinking with him, and associating with him.

That was because they disobeyed and were ever transgressing.' And he recited until he reached: 'And had they believed in Allah, and in the Prophet, and in what has been revealed to him, never would they have taken them as friends; but many of them are rebellious (5:78-81).' He said: \"And Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) was reclining, so he sat up and said: 'No!
