    "text": "Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: That the Prophet (ï·º) said: \"Let none of you wat with his left hand nor drink with his left hand, for indeed Ash-Shaitan eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand.\" He said: There are narrations on this topic from Jabir, 'Umar bin Abi Salamah, Salamah bin Al-Akwa', Anas bin Malik, and Hafsah. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. This is how Malik and Ibn 'Uyainah reported it from Az-Zuhri, from Abu Bakr bin 'Ubaidullah, from Ibn 'Umar. Ma'mar and 'Uqail reported it from Az-Zuhri, from Salim, from Ibn 'Umar. And the narration of Malik and Ibn 'Uyainah is more correct",
