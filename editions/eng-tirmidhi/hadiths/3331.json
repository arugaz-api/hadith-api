    "text": "Aishah narrated:“He frowned and turned away” was revealed about Ibn Umm Maktum the blind man. He came to the Messenger of Allah saying: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Guide me.’ At that time, there was a revered man from the idolaters with the Messenger of Allah. So the Messenger of Allah turned away from him and faced the other man, saying: ‘Do you think that there is something wrong with what I am saying?’ He said: ‘No.’ So it was about that that it was revealed.”",
