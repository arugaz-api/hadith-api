Their leader was stung so they came to us saying: 'Is there anyone among you who can treat a scorpion sting with Ruqyah?' I said: 'Yes I can. But I will not do any Ruqyah until you give us some sheep.' They said: 'Then we shall give you thirty sheep.' We accepted that,and I recited Al-Hamda [Lillah] seven times. He became better and we took the sheep.\" He said: \"We became concerned about that being permissible and said: 'Do not be hasty until we reach the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W).\" He said: \"When we arrived with him I mentioned what I did to him. He(S.A.W)said: 'How did you know that it was a Ruqyah? Take the sheep, and assign me a share among you",
