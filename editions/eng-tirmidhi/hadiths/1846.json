So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The food's blessing is in the Wudu' before it and the Wudu' after it.'\" He said: There are narrations on this topic from Anas and Abu Hurairah. [Abu 'Eisa said:] We do not know of this Hadith except as a narration of Qais bin Ar-Rabi'. Qais [bin Ar-Rabi'] was graded weak in Hadith. Abu Hashim Ar-Rumani's (a narrator in the chain) name is Yahya bin Dinar",
