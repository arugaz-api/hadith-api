Then he came to the Maqam and said: 'And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.' Then he performed two Rak'ah while the Maqam was between him and the House. Then he came to the (Black) Stone after the two Rak'ah to touch it, then he left to As-Safa - I think - he said: Indeed As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah",
