    "text": "Ibn Abbas narrated:\"Allah's Messenger would teach us the Tashah-hud just as he would teach us the Qur'an. He would say: (At-Tahiyyatu, al mubarakatu, as-salawatu at-tayyibatulillah. Salamun alaika ayyuhan-naibiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, salamun alaina wa ala ibadalillahis-salihin. Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa Raduluh.) 'All greetings, goodness, prayers, and pure words are for Allah. Peace be upon you O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and His blessings, Peace be upon us and all of the righteous worshippers of Allah. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is Allah's worshipper and Messenger",
