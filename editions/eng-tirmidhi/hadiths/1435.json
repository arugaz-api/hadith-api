    "text": "Narrated 'Imran bin Husain:\"A woman from Juhainah confessed before the Prophet (ﷺ) that she had committed adultery, and she said: 'I am pregnant.' So the Prophet (ﷺ) called for her guardian and said: 'Be good to her and if she gives birth to her child then tell me.' So he did so, and then he (ﷺ) gave the order that her clothes be bound tightly around her. Then he ordered her to be stoned and she was stoned. Then he performed (funeral) Salat for her. So 'Umar bin Al-Khattab said to him: 'O Messenger of Allah! You stoned her then you prayed for her?!' He said: 'She has repented a repentance that, if distributed among seventy of the people of Al-Madinah, it would have sufficed them. Have you ever seen something more virtuous than her sacrificing herself for the sake of Allah?",
