So the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said to him: 'Do you testify that I am the Messenger of Allah?' So he replied: 'Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger?' So the Prophet(s.a.w) said: 'I believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day.'Then the Prophet(s.a.w) said to him: 'What do you see?' He said: 'I see a throne above the water.' So the Prophet(s.a.w) said: 'He sees the throne of Iblis above the sea.' He said: 'What else do you see?' He said: 'I see a truthful one,and two liars- or two truthful ones and a liar.' So the Prophet (s.a.w)said:\"He has been confounded. So leave him",
