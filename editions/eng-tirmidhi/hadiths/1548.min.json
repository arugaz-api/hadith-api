They said: 'O Abu 'Abdullah! Should we charge them?' He said: 'Leave me to call them (to Islam) as I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) call them.' So Salman went to them and said: 'I am only a man from among you, a Persian, and you see that the Arabs obey me. If you become Muslims then you will have the likes of what we have, and from you will be required that which is required from us. If you refuse, and keep your religion, then we will leave you to it, and you will give us the Jizyah from your hands while you are submissive.' He said to them in Persian: 'And you are other than praiseworthy and if you refuse then we will equally resist you.' They said: 'We will not give you the Jizyah, we will fight you instead.' So they said: 'O Abu 'Abdullah! Should we charge them?' He said: 'No.'\" He said: \"So for three days he called them to the same (things), and then he said: 'Charge them.'\" He said: \"So we charged them, and we conquered the castle","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":1}}}
