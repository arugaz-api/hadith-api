Then send Salat upon me, because whoever sends Salat upon me, Allah will send Salat upon him ten times due to it. Then ask Allah that He gives me Al-Wasilah, because it is a place in Paradise which is not for anyone except for a slave from the slaves of Allah, and I hope that I am him. And whoever asks that I have Al-Wasilah, then (my) intercession will be made lawful for him",
