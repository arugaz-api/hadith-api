They looked at it, and the Messenger of Allah said: ‘Di you know what its name it?’ They said: ‘Yes. This is As-Sahab (cloud).’ The Messenger of Allah saidl: ‘Al-Muzn (rain cloud)?’ They said: ‘Yes. This is As-Sahab (cloud).’ Then the Messenger of Allah said: ‘Do you know how much distance there is between the heavens and the earth?’ They said: ‘No, by Allah we do not know.’ He said: ‘The distance between every two of them is either seventy-one, or two, or three, years, and the heaven that is above that one is like that.’ Until he enumerated Seven heavens like that. Then he said: ‘Above the seventh heaven is a sea, Between its highest part and its lowest is just as there is between one heaven to another heaven. Then above their backs is the Throne. Between its lowest and highest parts is the same as what is between one heaven to another heaven, and Allah is above that.’”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":372}}}
