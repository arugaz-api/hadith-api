Do you have anything? She said: 'Yes.' So she got some loaves of wheat bread, then she took out a Khimar of hers, and put the bread in it. Then she put it under my arm, and wrapped my upper body with part of it, and she sent me to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).\" He said: \"So I brought it to him, and I found the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sitting in the Masjid, and there were people with him. So I stood among them, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Has Abu Talhah sent you?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'With food?' I said: 'Yes.' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to those with him: 'Stand up.'\" So they left, and I left in front of them, until I came to Abu Talhah, and I told him (that they were coming). Abu Talhah said: 'O Umm Sulaim! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is coming with people, and we don't have anything to feed them.' Umm Sulaim said: 'Allah and His Messenger know best.'\" He said: \"So Abu Talhah departed until he met up with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah came, while Abu Talhah was with him, until they entered, when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Come O Umm Sulaim! What do you have?' So she brought him that bread, and he (ﷺ) ordered that it be broken into pieces. Umm Sulaim poured some butter from an oil-skin upon them, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited whatever Allah willed for him to say over it. Then he said: 'Let ten come.' So ten were admitted, and they ate until they were full, and then they left. Then he said: 'Let ten come.' So ten were admitted, and they ate until they were full, and they left. Then he said: 'Let ten come.' So ten were admitted, and they ate until they were full, and there were seventy or eighty men","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":26}}}
