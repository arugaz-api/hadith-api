    "text": "Adi bin Hatim narrated that the Messenger of Allah SAW said:\"There is no man among you except that his Lord shall converse with him on the Day of Judgement, there being no interpreter between him and Him (Allah). Then he looks to the south (his right) and does not see anything except the things he put forward (of good), then he looks to the north (his left) and he does not see anything except the things he put forward (of evil), then he turns to look before him to find he is facing the Fire.\" The Messenger of Allah SAW, said: \"Whoever among you is able to protect his face from [the heat of] the Fire – even with a piece of a date - then let him do so.\" (Sahih) [Abu 'Eisa said: This Hadith is Hasan Sahih]. Abu As-Sã'ib narrated to us: \"One day, Waki' narrated this Hadith to us from Al-'Amash. When Waki' was finished with this Hadith, he said: 'Whoever is present from the inhabitants of Khurãsãn, then let him seek the reward of spreading this Hadith in Khurãsãn.\" Abu 'Eisa said: The Jahmiyyah rejected this. [Abu As-Sã'ib's name is Salam bin Junadah bin Khãlid bin Jäbir bin Samurah Al-Kufi]. This Hadith is Hasan Sahih",
