Then 'Ali and Al-'Abbas came disputing. 'Umar said to them: ' I ask you, by Allah the One by Whose Will the heavens and the earth are maintained, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"We are not inherited from, what we leave is charity?\" They said: 'Yes.' 'Umar said: 'When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, Abu Bakr said: \"I am the caretaker of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)\" So you and he went to Abu Bakr and you sought your inheritance from the son of your brother, and he sought the inheritance of his wife from her father. So Abu Bakr said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"We are not inherited from, what we leave is charity.\" And Allah knows that he is truthful, innocent, instructing and following the truth.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] There is a lengthy story along with the Hadith. And this Hadith is Hasan Sahih Gharib as a narration of Malik bin Anas",
