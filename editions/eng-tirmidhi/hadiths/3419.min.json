O Allah give me faith and certainty after which there is no disbelief, and mercy, by which I may attain the high level of Your generosity in the world and the Hereafter. O Allah, I ask You for success [in that which You grant, and relief] in the Judgment, and the positions of the martyrs, and the provision of the successful, and aid against the enemies. O Allah, I leave to You my need, and my actions are weak, I am in need of Your mercy, so I ask You, O Decider of the affairs, and O Healer of the chests, as You separate me from the punishment of the blazing flame, and from seeking destruction, and from the trial of the graves. O Allah, whatever my opinion has fallen short of, and my intention has not reached it, and my request has not encompassed it, of good that You have promised to anyone from Your creation, or any good You are going to give to any of Your slaves, then indeed, I seek it from You and I ask You for it, by Your mercy, O Lord of the Worlds. O Allah, Possessor of the strong rope, and the guided affair, I ask You for security on the Day of the Threat, and Paradise on the Day of Immortality along with the witnesses, brought-close, who bow and prostrate, who fulfill the covenants, You are Merciful, Loving, and indeed, You do what You wish. O Allah, make us guided guiders and not misguided misguiders, an ally to Your friends, an enemy to Your enemies. We love due to Your love, those who love You, and hate, due to Your enmity those who oppose You. O Allah, this is the supplication (that we are capable of), and it is upon You to respond, and this is the effort (that we are capable of), and upon You is the reliance. O Allah, appoint a light in my heart for me, and a light in my grave, and light in front of me, and light behind me, and light on my right, and light on my left, and light above me, and light below me, and light in my hearing, and light in my vision, and light in my hair, and light in my skin, and light in my flesh, and light in my blood, and light in my bones. O Allah, magnify for me light, and appoint for me a light. Glory is to the One who wears Glory and grants by it. Glory is to the One for Whom glorification is not fitting except for Him, the Possessor of Honor and Bounties, Glory is to the Possessor of Glory and Generosity, Glory is to the Possessor of Majesty and Honor’ (Allāhumma innī as'aluka raḥmatan min `indika tahdī bihā qalbī, wa tajma`u bihā amrī, wa talummu bihā sha`athī, wa tuṣliḥu bihā ghā'ibī, wa tarfa`u bihā shāhidī, wa tuzakkī bihā `amalī, wa tulhimunī bihā rushdī, wa taruddu bihā ulfatī, wa ta`ṣimunī bihā min kulli sū'in.
