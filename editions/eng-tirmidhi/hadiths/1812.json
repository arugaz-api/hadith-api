Indeed Ash-Shaitan does not open what is closed, nor undo what is fastened, nor uncover a vessel, but the small vermin may cause a fire in people's houses.\" He said: There are narrations on this topic from Ibn 'Umar, Abu Hurairah, and Ibn 'Abbas. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, and it has been reported through other routes from Jabir",
