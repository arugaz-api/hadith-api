Then a boy shall be born to them, having one eye in which there is some defect, providing little use. His eyes sleep but his heart does not sleep.' Then the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) described his parents for us: 'His father is tall, with little fat, with a nose as if it were a beak. His mother is a bulky woman with long breasts.'\" So Abu Bakrah said: \"I heard about a child being born to some Jews in Al-Madinah. So Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam and I went until we entered upon his parents. They appeared as the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) had described them. We said: 'Do you have any children?' They said: 'We remained for thirty years without any children being born to us, then we bore a boy, having one eye in which there is some defect, providing little use. His eyes sleep but his heart does not sleep.'\" He said: \"So we were leaving them, when he appeared, glittering in the sunlight in a velvet garment, murmuring something. He uncovered his head and said: 'What were you saying?' We said: 'Did you hear what we were saying?' He said: 'Yes, that my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":33,"hadith":91}}}
