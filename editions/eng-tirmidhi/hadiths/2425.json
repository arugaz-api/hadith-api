    "text": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said:\"The people will face three presentations on the Day of Judgement. As for (the first) two presentations, they are the arguments and the excuses, as for the third presentation, upon that the records will fly into the hands. Some will take them in their right hand, and some will take them in their left hand.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is not correct, because Al-Hasan did not hear from Abu Hurairah. Some of them reported it from 'Ali bin 'Ali - and he is Ar-Rifa'i - from Al-Hasan, from Abu Musã from the Prophet SAW. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is not correct, because Al-Hasan did not hear from Abü Musa",
