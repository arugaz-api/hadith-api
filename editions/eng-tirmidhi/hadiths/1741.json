    "text": "Narrated Ibn 'Umar: \"The Prophet (ï·º) had a ring of gold made for him which he wore on his right (hand). Then he sat on the Minbar and said: 'I did indeed have this ring on my right hand' then he discarded it and the people discarded their rings.\" He said: There are narrations on this topic from 'Ali, Jabir, 'Abdullah bin Ja'far, Ibn 'Abbas, 'Aishah, and Anas. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Ibn 'Umar is Hasan Sahih Hadith. This Hadith has been reported similarly from 'Nafi, from Ibn 'Umar, through routes other than this, and it was not mentioned in it that the ring was on his right hand",
