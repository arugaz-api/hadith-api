I had taken a tanned skin, si I tore it in the middle, and out it over my neck, and wrapped my mid-section, fastening it with a palm leave. I was severely hungry, and if there was food in the house of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) I would have eaten some of it. I went in search of something. I passed by a Jew on his property drawing water (from a well) with a pulley. I watched him from a gap in the fence. He said: \"what is wrong with you O Arab1 Would you like to get a date for every bucket?\" I said: \"Yes. Open the door so I can come in.\" He opened the door, I entered and he gave me his bucket. Then for every bucket I pulled out, he would give me a date, until when it was enough for me. I put his bucket down and said: \"I think I had enough to eat\" then I scooped some water to drink it. Then I came to the Masjid and found the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) in it","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":59}}}
