    "text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah: \"The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) prohibited the Gharar sale, and the Hasah sale.\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Sa'eed, and Anas. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith of Abu Hurairah is Hasan Sahih Hadith. This Hadith is acted upon according to the people of knowledge, they dislike the Gharar. Ash-Shafi'i said: \"The Gharar sale includes selling fish that are in the wate, selling a slave that has escaped, selling birds that are in the sky, and similar type of sales. And the meaning of Hasah sale is when the seller says to the buyer: 'When I toss the pebble at you, then the sale between you and I is final.' This resembles the sale of Munabadhah and this is one of the selling practices of the people of Jahiliyyah",
