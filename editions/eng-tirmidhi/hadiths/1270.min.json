[Abu 'Eisa said:] Ishaq bin Mansur said: \"I said to Ahmad: what if when the two parties disagree and there is no proof (what is done)?' He said: 'The saying of the owner of the merchandise is taken as valid or they both refuse.' And Ishaq said as he did, and that in every case where his saying is taken, he must swear.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] Similar to this has been reported from some of the people of knowledge among the Tabi'in, Shuraih is among those","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":14,"hadith":72}}}
