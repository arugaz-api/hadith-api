As-salamu alaika ayyuhannabiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu, as-salamu alaina wa ala ibadillahis-salihin. Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wa ashadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa Rasuluh.)

I testify that nne has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is Allah's servant and Messenger",
