    "text": "Al-Qasim bin Al-Fadl Al-Huddani narrated from Yusuf bin Sa’d, who said:“A man stood up in front of Al-Hasan bin Ali, after he pledged to Mu’awiyah, so he said: ‘You have made fools of the believers.’ – or: ‘O you who has made fools of the believers’ – So he said: ‘Do not scold me so, may Allah have mercy upon you, for indeed the Prophet had a dream in which he saw Banu Umayyah upon his Minbar. That distressed him, so (the following) was revealed: Verily We have granted you Al-Kauthar (O Muhammad) meaning a river in Paradise, and (the following) was revealed: ‘Verily We have sent it down on the Night of Al-Qadr. And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is? The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months, in which Banu Umayyah rules after you O Muhammad.” Al-Qasim said: “So we counted them, and found that they were one-thousand months, not a day more nor less.”",
