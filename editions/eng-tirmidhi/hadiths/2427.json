    "text": "Anas narrated that the Prophet (s.a.w) said:\"The son of Adam will be brought on the Day of Judgement as if he is a goat kid to be stood before Allah, Most High. Allah will say to him: 'I gave to you, I granted you, and I bestowed favors upon you. So what did you do?' So he says: 'I collected it, increased it, and left it as more than what it was. So return me and I shall give it all to You.' So He will say to him: 'Show me what you have prepared.' So he says: 'My Lord! I collected it, increased it and left it more than it was, So return me and I shall give it all to You.' So when the servant does not present any good he will be entered into the Fire.\" Abu 'Eisa said: More than one narrator reported this from Al-Hasan as his saying. And they did not rely upon Ism√§'il bin Muslim who was graded weak in Hadith [due to his memory]. There are narrations on this topic from Abu Hurairah and Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri",
