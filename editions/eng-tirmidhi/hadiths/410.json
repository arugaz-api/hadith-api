The rich pray as we pray, they fast as we fast, but they have wealth with which they free slaves and which they give in charity.' He said: 'When you perform Salat, then say: 'Subhan Allah' thirty-three times, and: 'Al-Hamdulillah' thirty-three times, and: 'Allahu Akbar' thirty-four times, and 'La ilaha illallah' ten times. With that you will have surprassed them, and none would surpass you afterwards",
