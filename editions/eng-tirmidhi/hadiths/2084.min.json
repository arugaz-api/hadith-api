Let him stand in a flowing river facing the direction of it and say: Allahummashfi 'abdaka wa saddik Rasulak ('In the name off Allah. O Allah! Cure your slave and testify to Your Messenger.)' Doing so after Salat As-Subh(Fajr) and before the rising of the sun. Let him submerse himself in it three times, for three days. If he is not cured in three, then five. If he is not cured in five, then seven. If he is not cured in seven, then nine. For indeed it will not remain after nine, with the permission of Allah","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":49}}}
