    "text": "Narrated Samurah bin Jundab: That the Prophet (ï·º) said: \"When one of you comes upon livestock, if its owner is with it then seek his permission. If he permits him then let him milk it and drink. If there is no one with it then call out three times, if someone answers then seek his permission. If no one answers then let him milk it and drink without carrying (any of it away).\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from Ibn 'Umar and Abu Sa'eed. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Samurah is a Hasan Gharib Sahih Hadith. This is acted upon according to some of the people of knowledge, and it is the view of Ahmad and Ishaq. [Abu 'Eisa said:] 'Ali bin Al-Madini said: \"It is correct that Al-Hasan heard this from Samurah.\" Some of the people of Hadith criticized the narrations of Al-Hasan from Samurah, they said that he only narrated from a writing of Samurah",
