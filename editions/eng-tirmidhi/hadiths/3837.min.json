We hear from him what we do not hear from you, or does he attribute to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what he did not say?' He said: 'As for his having heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what we did not hear from him, then that is because he was poor, having nothing, a guest of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), his hand was in the hand of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). And we used to be people of houses and wealth, and we used to come to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at the two ends of the day. I do not doubt that he heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what we did not hear, and you will not find anyone in whom there is good attributing to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what he did not say","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":237}}}
