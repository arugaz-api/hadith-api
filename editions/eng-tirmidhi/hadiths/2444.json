    "text": "Al-'Abbas narrated from Abu Sallam Al-Habashi who said:\"'Umar bin 'Abdul-'Aziz summoned me so I got a ride on a mule.\" [He said:] \"When he entered upon him, he said: 'O Commander of the Believers! My riding mule was troublesome for me.' So he said: 'O Abu Sallam!I did not want to trouble you, but a Hadith which you narrated-from Thawban, from the Prophet (s.a.w) about the Hawd-was conveyed to me,and I wanted you to narrate it directly to me.\"'Abu Sallam said: \"Thawban narrated to me from The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) who said 'My Hawd (is as large as) from 'Adan to 'Amman of Al-Balqa', its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its cups are as numerous as the stars, whoever drinks one drink from it, he will never be thirsty after that again. The first people to arrive at it are the poor among the Muhajirin with disheveled heads, dirty clothes, those whom the women of favor would not marry, nor would the doors be open for them.' 'Umar said: 'But I have married a women of favor and the doors are open for me. I married Fatimah bint 'Abdul-Malik. I shall certainly not wash my head until it is disheveled, nor wash my garment which touches my body until it becomes dirty.\" Another chain reports a similar narration",
