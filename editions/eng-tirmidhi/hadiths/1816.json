    "text": "Narrated Anas bin Malik: That the Prophet (ï·º) said: \"Indeed Allah is pleased with the slave who, upon eating his food or drinking his drink, he praises Him for it.\" He said: There are narrations on this topic from 'Uqbah bin 'Amir, Abu Sa'eed, 'Aishah, Abu Ayyub, and Abu Hurairah. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan. More than one narrator has reported it from Zakariyya bin Abi Za'idah similarly, and we do not know of it except through the narration of Zakariyya bin Abi Za'idah",
