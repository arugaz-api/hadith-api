    "text": "Narrated Al-Ja'd bin Abi 'Uthman:from Anas bin Malik: \"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got married, and he went in with his wife.\" He said: \"So my mother, Umm Sulaim prepared some Hais in a Tawr (a vessel made of brass and stone) and said: 'O Anas! Take this to the Prophet (ﷺ).' I said to him: 'My mother sent this to you, and she conveys her Salam, and says: 'This is a little something from us for you.'\" He said: 'Put it down.' Then he said: 'Go and invite so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so for me, and whomever you meet.'\" He named some people, and said: \"I invited those he named, and whomever I met.\" - He (Al-Ja'd) said: \"I said to Anas: 'How many of you were there?' He said: 'Roughly about three-hundred.'\" - He (Anas) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: 'O Anas! Bring me the Tawr.'\" He said: \"They entered until the Suffah (a shaded part of the Masjid in Al-Madinah) and the apartment were full. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Let groups of ten in, and let each person eat what is near him.'\" He said: \"They ate until they were full.\" He said: \"A group exited, and another group entered, until all of them ate.'\" He said: \"He said to me: 'O Anas! Remove it.'\" He said: \"So I took it. I could not tell if there was more when I first put it down, or when I picked it up.\" He said: \"Groups of them sat talking in the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife sat facing the wall. They began to be burdensome on the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to greet his women folk, then he returned, they realized that they had overburdened him, so they hastened for the gate and all of them exited. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came until he lowered the curtain, and entered while I was sitting in the apartment. He did not remain there long before he left me, and these Ayat were revealed. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to recite them to the people: 'O you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet's house unless permission is given to you for a meal, not to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meals, dispense without sitting for a talk. Verily, such annoys the Prophet...' till the end of the Ayah (33:53)' Al-Ja'd said: \"Anas said: 'I am the earliest of the people to encounter these Ayat, and to be screened from the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)",
