    "text": "Narrated Thumamah bin Hazn Al-Qushairi:\"I was present at the house when 'Uthman appeared above them saying: 'Bring me your two companions who have gathered you against me.'\" He said: \"So they were brought as if they were two camels, or as if they were two donkeys.\" He said: \"'Uthman appeared above them and said: 'I ask you by Allah and Islam! Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to Al-Madinah and there was no water in it that was sweet except the well of Rumah, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Who will purchase the well of Rumah and place his bucket alongside the buckets of the Muslims, in exchange for better than that in Paradise?' So I bought it with the core of my wealth, and today you prevent me from drinking from it, so that I would have to drink from the water of the sea?' They said: 'O Allah! Yes!' He said: 'I ask you by Allah and Islam! Do you know that the Masjid, was insufficient for its people, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Who will purchase the land of the family of so-and-so, and add it to the Masjid in exchange for better than that in Paradise?' So I bought it with the core of my wealth, and today you prevent me from praying two Rak'ah in it?' They said: 'O Allah! Yes.' He said: 'I ask you by Allah and Islam! Do you know that I prepared the 'army of distress' from my wealth?' They said: 'O Allah! Yes!' Then he said: 'I ask you by Allah and Islam! Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was on (mount) Thabir of Makkah, and with him was Abu Bakr, and 'Umar, and myself. The mountain began shaking until its rocks fell to its bottom.' He said: 'So he (ﷺ) stomped it with his foot and said: \"Be still O Thabir! For there is none upon except a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs?\"' They said: 'O Allah! Yes!' He said: 'Allah is Great! Bear witness by the Lord of the Ka'bah that I am a martyr!' - three times",
