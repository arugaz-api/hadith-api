So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to them: 'Do not associate anything with Allah, nor commit unlawful intercourse, nor take a life which Allah has made prohibited, except for what is required (in the law), nor steal, nor practice magic, nor hasten to damage the reputation of an innocent person in front of a ruler, so that he will be killed, nor consume Riba, nor falsely accuse the chaste woman, nor turn to flee on the day of the march (i.e. flee from war).' - Shu'bah was in doubt - 'and for you Jews particularly, to not violate the Sabbath.'\" He said: \"So they kissed his hands and his feet and they said: 'We bear witness that you are a Prophet.'
