Then a man said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Marry her to me if you have no need of her.\" So he said: \"Do you have anything to give her as a dowry?\" He said: \"I have nothing except this Izar.\" So the Messenger of Allah said: \"If you give her your Izar then you will have no Izar, so search for something.\" He said: \"I did not find anything.\" He said: \"Search for something, even if it just an iron ring.\" He said: So he searched but he did not find anything.
