Their uncle took their wealth, without leaving any wealth for them, and they will not be married unless they have wealth.' He said: 'Allah will decide on that matter.' The ayah about inheritance was revealed, so the Messenger of Allah(S.A.W) sent (word) to their Uncle saying: Give the two daughters of Sa'd two thirds, and give their mother one eighth, and whatever remains, then it is for you",
