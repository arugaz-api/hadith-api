And the space that a bow of one of you - or the space that his hand - would occupy in Paradise is better than the world and what is in it. And if a woman among the women inhabiting Paradise were to appear to the people of the earth, then she would illuminate what is between the ( the heavens and the earth), and a pleasant scent would fill up what is between them, and the scarf on her head is better than the world and what is in it.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih",
