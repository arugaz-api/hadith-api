So The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) came to visit me, and I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (S.A.W)! Indeed I have a great deal of wealth and I do not have any heirs except my daughter, so should I will all of my wealth?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then two-thirds of my wealth?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then half?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then a third' He said: 'No.' A third and a third is too much. If you leave your heirs without need it is better than to leave them in poverty begging from the people. Indeed you do not do any spending (on your family) except that you are rewarded for it, even the morsel of food you raise to your wife's mouth.'\" He said: \"I said: 'Will I be left behind from my emigration?' He said: 'You will not be left behind after me,and do righteous deeds intending Allah's Face, except that it will add to your elevation in rank. Perhaps you will remain until some people benefit from you and others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels. But the case of Sa'd bin Khawlah is sad.'\" the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) felt sorry for him dying in Makkah","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":30,"hadith":1}}}
