He is obscure among the people such that the fingers are not pointed towards him. His provisions are only what is sufficient and he is patient with that.\" Then he tapped with his fingers and said: \"His death comes quickly, his mourners are few, and his inheritance is little.\"With this (the above), chain it is narrated that the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"My Lord presented to me, that He would make the valley of Makkah into gold for me, I said: 'No O Lord! But being filled for a day and hungry for a day\"-or he said: \"three days\" or something like that- \"So when I am hungry, I would beseech You and remember You, and when I am full I would be grateful to You and praise You","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":44}}}
