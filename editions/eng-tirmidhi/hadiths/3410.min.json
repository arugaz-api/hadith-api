And indeed, they are easy, and those who act upon them are few: He glorifies Allah at the end of every prayer ten times (saying Subḥān Allāh) and praises Him ten times saying (Al-Ḥamdulillāh) and extols His greatness ten times (saying Allāhu Akbar).’”He said: “And I have seen the Messenger of Allah counting them with his hand. He said: ‘So this is one hundred and fifty with the tongue, and one thousand and five hundred on the Scale. When you go to bed, you glorify Him, extol His greatness, and praise Him a hundred times, so this is one hundred with the tongue and one thousand on the Scale. Which of you perform two thousand and five hundred evil deeds in a single day and night?’ They said: ‘How could we not guard over them?’ He said: ‘Shaitan comes to one of you when he is in his Salat and says: “Remember such and such, remember such and such” until he turns perhaps he will not do it. And he comes to him and he is lying down and makes him sleepy until he falls asleep.’”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":41}}}
