    "text": "Ibn Mas'ud narrated that the Messenger of Allah SAW said:\"The feet of the son of Adam shall not move from before his Lord on the Day of Judgement, until he is asked about five things: About his life and what he did with it, about his youth and what he wore it out in, about his wealth and how he earned it, and spent it upon, and what he did with what he knew.\" (Da'if) [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Gharib, we do not know of it as a narration of Ibn Mas'Ã¼d from the Prophet except through the narration of Husain bin Qais. Husain [bin Qais] was graded weak in Hadith [due to his memory]. There are narrations on this topic from Abu Barzah and Abu Sa'eed",
