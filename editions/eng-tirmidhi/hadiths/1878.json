He threw it, and said: 'I have indeed forbade him, but he refused to stop! Indeed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited drinking from silver and gold vessels, and from wearing silk and Dibaj, and he (ﷺ) said: \"If is for them in this world, and for you in the Hereafter.\" He said: There are narrations on this topic from Umm Salamah, Al-Bara', and 'Aishah. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih",
