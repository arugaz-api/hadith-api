Indeed the Messenger of Allah came out upon a circle of his Companions and said: ‘what has caused you to gather for this sitting?’ They said: ‘We have gathered for this sitting to remember Allah, and praise Him for His having guided us to Islam, and having bestowed blessings upon us.’ So he said: ‘By Allah, nothing caused you to gather for this sitting except for that?’ He said: ‘Indeed, I did not ask you out of suspicion, verily Jibra’il came to me and informed me that Allah boasts of you to the angels.’”",
