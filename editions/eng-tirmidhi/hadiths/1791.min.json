He said: 'Yes.'\" He said: \"I said: 'Should I eat it?' He said: 'Yes.'\" He said: 'I said: 'Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say that ?' He said: 'Yes.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Some of the people of knowledge followed this. They did not see any harm eating badger. This is the view of Ahmad and Ishaq. A Hadith has been related from the Prophet (ﷺ) indicating disapproval of eating badger but its chain is not strong. Some of the people of knowledge disliked eating badger. This is the view of Ibn Al-Mubarak. Yahya bin Al-Qattan said: \"Jarir bin Hazm reported this Hadith from 'Abdullah bin 'Ubaid bin 'Umair, from Ibn Abi 'Ammar, from Jabir, from 'Umar, as his saying. And the narration of Ibn Juraij (a narrator in the chain of this Hadith) is more correct. And Ibn Abi 'Ammar is 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Abdullah bin Abi 'Ammar Al-Makki","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":4}}}
