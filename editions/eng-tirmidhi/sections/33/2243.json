    "text": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said:\"Faith is Yemeni, and disbelief is from the direction of the east. Tranquility is for the people of sheep, and wickedness and Riya is in those who boast among the people of horses and the people of camels. Al-Masih – that is Ad-Dajjal- will come, and when he reaches behind Uhud, the angels will turn his face to the direction of Ash-Sham, and is there that he will be destroyed.” (Sahih)",
