When you see what you dislike, then say: 'Allahumma inna nas-aluka min khairi hadhihir-rih, wa khairi ma fiha wa khairi ma umirat bihi wa na'udhu bika min sharri hadhihir-rih wa sharri ma fiha wa sharri ma umirat bihi' ('O Allah! Indeed we ask you of the good of this wind, and the good of what is in it, and the good of what it has been commanded. And we seek refuge in You from the evil of this wind, and the evil of what is in it, and the evil of what it has been commanded)",
