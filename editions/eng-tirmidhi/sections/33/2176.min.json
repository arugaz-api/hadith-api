And surely my Ummah's authority shall reach over all that was shown to me of it. And I have been granted the two treasures; the red and the white. I asked my Lord that my Ummah is not to be destroyed by a universal drought, and that He does not overcome them by enemies outside of them, reaching to their heart of power. My Lord said: 'O Muhammad! When I issue a decree it is not reversed. I have granted for your Ummah that they shall not be destroyed by universal drought. And that they not be overcome by enemies outside of themselves reaching to their heart of power- even if they gather against them from all the regions.\"' Or he said: \"Among the regions. But some of them will destroy others, and some will capture others","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":33,"hadith":19}}}
