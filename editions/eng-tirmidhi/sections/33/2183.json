    "text": "Hudhaifah bin Asid said:\"The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) stood over us on a balcony, and we were discussing the Hour. So the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said: 'The Hour shall not be established until you see ten signs. The sun rising from its setting place, Ya'juj and Ma'juj, the beast of the earth, and three collapses of the earth: A collapse in the east, a collapse in the west and a collapse in the 'Arabian peninsula. And a fire that comes out of a place within 'Adan, driving the people, or gathering the people, camping where they camp, and resting where they rest",
