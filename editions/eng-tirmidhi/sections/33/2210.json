    "text": "Ali bin Abi Talib narrated that the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said:\"When my Ummah does fifteen things, the afflictions will occur in it.\" It was said: \"What are they O Messenger of Allah?\" He said: \"When Al-Maghnam (the spoils of war) are distributed (preferentially), trust is usurped, Zakah is a fine, a man obeys his wife and disobeys his mother, he is kind to his friend and abandons his father, voices are raised in the Masajid, the leader of the people is the most despicable among them, the most honored man is the one whose evil the people are afraid of, intoxicants are drunk, silk is worn (by males), there is a fascination for singing slave-girls and music, and the end of this Ummah curses its beginning. When that occurs, anticipate a red wind, collapsing of the earth, and transformation",
