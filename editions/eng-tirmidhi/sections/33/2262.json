They said: 'His daughter.' So the Prophet(s.a.w) said: 'A people will never succeed who give their leadership to a woman.'\" He said: \"So when 'Aishah arrived - meaning in Al-Basrah - I remembered the saying of Messenger of Allah (ï·º), so Allah restrained me by it.\" Abu Eisa said: This Hadith is [Hasan] Sahih",
