    "text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Whoever meets Allah without any traces from Jihad he meets Allah with a defect. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Gharib as a narration of Al-Walid bin Muslim from Isma'il bin Rafi'. Isma'il bin Rafi' was graded weak by some of the people of Hadith. I heard Muhammad saying: \"He is trustworthy, average (Muqarib) in Hadith.\" This Hadith has been reported from Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (ﷺ) through other than this route. Regarding the Hadith of Salman, its chain is not connected, Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir did not see Salman Al-Farisi. This Hadith has been reported from Ayyub bin Musa, from Makhul, from Shurahbil bin As-Simt from Salman, from the Prophet (ﷺ)",
