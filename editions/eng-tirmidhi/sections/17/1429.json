Then he turned away from him (again) until he had testified against himself four times. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Are you insane?\" He said:\"No\" He said: \"Are you married?\" He said: \"Yes\". So he gave the order and he was stoned at the Musalla. He ran when he was stuck by the stones, and he was caught and stoned until he died. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spoke well of him but he did not perform the (funeral) Salat for him",
