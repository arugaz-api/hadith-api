Allow me to tell you what the Messenger of Allah said on the day following the Conquest of Makkah. My ears heard it, my heard understood it thoroughly, and with my own eyes, I saw the Prophet when he - after glorifying and praising Allah - said: \"Indeed Allah, the Most High, made Makkah a sanctuary, it was not made a sanctuary by the people. So it is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood it, nor to cut down its trees. If anybody tries to use the Messenger of Allah to make an excuse for fighting in it, then say to him: 'Indeed Allah permitted His Messenger and He did not permit you.' Allah only allowed it for me for a few hours of one day, and today its sanctity has returned as it was before. So let the one who is present convey to the one who is absent.\" Abu Shuraih was asked: \"What was Amr bin Sa'eeds reply to you?\" He said: \"I am more knowledgeable about that than you Abu Shuraih! The Haram does not give protection to a disobedient person, nor a person fleeing for murder, nor fleeing for (Kharbah) lawlessness",

Be calmm.' Then he came to Jama and performed the two Salat there combined. When the morning came, he went to Quzah and stood there and said: 'This is Quzah, and it is a place of standing, and all of Jama is a place for standing.' Then he departed until he arrived at Wadi Muhassir. Then he stuck his she-camel and she trotted until he passed the valley. Then he stopped and took Al-Fadl as a companion rider and went to the Jamrah to stone it. Then he went to Al-Manhar and said: 'This is Al-Manhar, and all of Mina is a place for sacrifice.' A young girl from Khath'am came to ask him for a verdict, she said: 'Indeed my father is an elderly man who has lived until Allah has made Hajj obligatory, so would he be rewarded if I perform Hajj for him? He said: 'Perform Hajj for your father.'\" He said: \"And he turned the neck of Al Fadl. So Al-Abbas said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Why did you turn the neck of your cousin?' He said: 'I saw a young man and a young woman, and they were not safe from Shaitan.' A man came to him and said, 'O Messenger of Allah! I performed (Tawaf) Al-Ifadah before shaving.' He said: 'Shave, and there is no harm'\" - or: 'Clip and there is no harm'\" He said: \"Someone else came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! I did the sacrifice before stoning.' So he said: 'Stone, and there is no harm.'\" He said: \"Then he went to the House (Ka'bah) to perform Tawaf around it, then he went to Zamzam and said: 'O tribe of Abdul-Muttalib!
