    "text": "Amr bin Shu`aib narrated from his father, from his grandfather, that :The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever glorifies Allah a hundred times in the morning and a hundred in the night, he is like one who performs Hajj a hundred times. And whoever praises Allah a hundred times in the morning and a hundred in the night, he is like one who provides a hundred horses in the cause of Allah.” – or he said – “went out on a hundred military expeditions. And whoever pronounced At-Tahlil of Allah a hundred times in the night, he is like the one who freed a hundred slaves from the offspring of Isma`il, and whoever extols Allah’s greatness a hundred times in the day and a hundred in the night, none shall bring on that day, more than what he brought, except one who said similar to what he said, or increased upon it.”",
