    "text": "Abu Hurairah or Abu Sa`eed Al-Khudri narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Indeed, Allah has angels who go about on the earth in addition to the Kuttab of people. So when they find groups of people remembering Allah, they call to one another: ‘Come to that which you have been seeking.’ They will come and cover them up to the lowest heaven. Allah will say: ‘What were My worshippers doing when you left them?’ They will say: ‘We left them as they were praising You, glorifying You, and remembering You.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘Have they seen Me?’ They say: ‘No.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘How would it be had they seen Me?’ They will say: ‘Had they seen You, they would have been more ardent in praise of You, more ardent in glorification of You, more ardent in remembrance of You.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘And what do they seek?’” He (ﷺ) said: “They will say: ‘They seek Paradise.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘So have they seen it?’” He (ﷺ) said: “So they will say: ‘No.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘So how would it be had they seen it?’” He (ﷺ) said: “They will say: ‘Had they seen it, they would be more ardent in seeking it, and more eager for it.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘So from what thing do they seek refuge?’ They will say: ‘They seek refuge from the Fire.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘And have they seen it?’ So they will say: ‘No.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘So how would it be had they seen it?’ So they will say: ‘Had they seen it, they would be more ardent in fear of it, and more ardent in seeking refuge from it.’” He (ﷺ) said: “So He will say: ‘So I do call You to witness that I have forgiven them.’ So they will say: ‘Indeed among them is so-and-so, a sinner, he did not intend them, he only came to them for some need.’ So He will say: ‘They are the people, that none who sits with them shall be miserable.’”",
