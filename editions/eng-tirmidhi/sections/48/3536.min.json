So have you retained anything from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) concerning that?’ He said: ‘Yes, when we were travelers, he (ﷺ) used to order us not to remove our Khuff for three days and nights, except from sexual impurity, but not from defecation, urination, and sleep.’” He said: “So I said: ‘So have you memorized anything from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) concerning love?’ He said: ‘Yes, we were in one of our journeys with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when a man, a harsh, foolish Bedouin, who had been at the end of the group, called him with a loud voice, saying: “O Muhammad! O Muhammad!” So the people said to him “Mah! Indeed, you have been prohibited from this.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) responded to him with similar to his voice: “Come.” So he said: “A man loves a people but he has not reached them?” He said: ‘So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “A man is with whomever he loves.”’ Zirr said: “He did not cease reporting to me until he had reported that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has appointed a gate in the west - its width is the distance of a seventy-year journey - for repentance: it shall not be locked until the sun rises from its direction, and that is the Statement of Allah, Blessed be He and Most High, of the Ayah: The Day some of the signs of your Lord come, no soul shall be benefited by its believing.”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":167}}}
