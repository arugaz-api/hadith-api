    "text": "Umar bin Al-Khattab narrated:That the Prophet (ﷺ) sent an expedition in the direction of Najd. They gained many spoils of war and returned quickly. A man among those who did not go out said: “We have not seen an expedition quicker in return or greater in spoils than this expedition.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Should I not direct you to a group greater in spoils and quicker in return? A group who attended Salat As-Subh, then sat remembering Allah until the sun rose, for these are quicker in return and greater in spoils.”",
