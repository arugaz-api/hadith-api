    "text": "Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said:“We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a military expedition. When we returned, we overlooked Al-Madinah, and the people were pronouncing the Takbir, and they raised their voices with it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Verily, your Lord is not deaf nor absent, [and] He is between you and between the heads of your mounts.’ Then he said: ‘O `Abdullah bin Qais, should I not inform you of a treasure from the treasures of Paradise: Lā ḥawla wa lā quwwata illā billāh (There is no might or power except by Allah).’”",
