{"author":"Jami At Tirmidhi","hadith":{"hadithnumber":198,"arabicnumber":198,"text":"Bilal narrated:\"Allah's Messenger said [to me]: 'Do not say the Tathwib for any prayer except the Fajr prayer.'\" [He said:] There is something on this topic from Abu Mahdhurah. Abu `Eisa said: We do not know of the Hadith of Bilal except as a narration of Abu Isra'il Al-Mula'i. Abu Isra'il did not hear this Hadith from Al-Hakam bin `Utaibah. He said: He only reported it from Al-Hasan bin `Umarah, from Al-Hakam bin `Utaibah. Abu Isra'il's name is [Isma`il bin Abi Ishaq, and he is not strong according to the people of Hadith. The people of knowledge have differed over the interpretation of At-Tathwib. Some of them say that At-Tathwib is when one says \"As-Salatu Khairummin An-Nawm, (prayer is better than sleep)\" for the Adhan of Fajr. This is the saying of Ibn Al-Mubarak and Ahmad. Ishaq said something different about At-Tathwib, he said: \"[The disliked Tathwib] is something that the people started after the Prophet; when the Mu'adh-dhin calls the Adhan and the people are slow in coming, so between the Adhan and the Iqamah he says: 'Qad Qamatis-Salat, Hayya `Alasalat, Hayya `AlalFalah. (Prayer is ready, come to prayer, come to success.)\" [He said:] This Tathwib, which Ishaq mentioned, is the one that the people of knowledge dislike, which they innovated after the Prophet. But Ibn Al-Mubarak and Ahmad explained that At-Tathwib is when the Mu'adh-dhin says: \"As-Salatu Khairum minan-Nawm, (prayer is better than sleep)\" for the Adhan of Fajr. And this is the correct saying, and it is called At-Tathawwub as well, and this is the one chosen by the people of knowledge, and it is their opinion. It has been reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar that he would say: \"As-Salatu Khairum-minan-Nawm, (prayer is better than sleep)\" for Fajr. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said: \"I entered a Masjid with `Abdullah bin `Umar in which the Adhan was called, and we wanted to pray in it. Then the Mu'adh-dhin said the Tathwib. So `Abdullah bin `Umar left the Masjid and said: 'Let us leave the place of this innovator' And he did not pray in it.\" [He said:] `Abdullah only disliked the Tathwib that the people invented later on","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":50}}}
