When a man among his Companions narrated to me I ask him to swear an oath to me about it, and when he swears an oath to me I trust him. And Abu Bakr narrated to me - and Abu Bakr told the truth - he said: \"I heard Allah's Messenger (S) saying: 'There is no man who commits a sin, then makes Wudu, then performs Salat, then seeks forgiveness from Allah, except that Allah forgives him.' Then he recited this Ayah: Those who when they have committed Fahishah or wronged themselves with eveil, remember Allah. (3:135) until the end of the Ayah",
