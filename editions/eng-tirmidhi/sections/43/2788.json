And he prohibited Mitharatil-Urjawan (Mitharah was some type of saddle cloth. Some of the people of knowledge say it was a certain kind of cloth made of silk, and it preceded earlier under no. 1760. They disagree over Al-Urjawan, and perhaps it means whatever is red, meaning the Red Mitahrah, see Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi)",
