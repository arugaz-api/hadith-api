    "text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah: \"The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) prohibited that a man should put on sandals while he is standing.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib. 'Ubaidullah bin 'Amr Ar-Raqqi reported this Hadith from Ma'mar, from Qatadah, from Anas. Both of the Ahadith are not correct according to the people of Hadith. Al-Harith bin Nabhan is not a Hafiz according to them, and we do not know any basis for the narration of Qatadah from Anas",
