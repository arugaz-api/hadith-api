    "text": "Narrated Abu An-Nadr: From 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah, that he entered upon Abu Talhah Al-Ansari to pay him a visit (while he was ill), and he found Sahl bin Hunaif with him. He said: \"Abu Talhah called for someone to remove a sheet that was under him. Sahl said to him: 'Why did you remove it?' He replied: 'Because it contains images on it, and the Prophet (ï·º) said about them what you know.' Sahl said: 'Do he not say: Except for markings on a garment?' He said: 'Yes, but this is better to me.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih",
