I said: 'I am Waqid bin 'Amr [bin Sa'd bin Ma'adh].'\" He said: \"So he began to cry and he said: 'You resemble Sa'd. Sa'd was one of the greatest people, and of the tallest. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sent a cloak of Dibaj with gold woven into it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wore it and ascended the Minbar. Then he stood, or sat, and the people began touching it, and they said: 'We never saw a garment like this before today.' So he said: 'Are you amazed at this ? The handkerchiefs of Sa'd in Paradise are better than what you see.'\" He said: There is something on this topic from Asma' bint Abu Bakr. This Hadith is Sahih",
