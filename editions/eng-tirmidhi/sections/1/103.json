    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas narrated that his maternal aunt Maimunah said:\"I prepared some water for the Prophet to perform Ghusl for Janabah with. So he turned the vessel with his left hand, (pouring some water) over his right. Then he washed his hands. Then he entered his hand into the vessel to pour water over his private area, then he rubbed his hands on the wall, or the ground. Then he rinsed out his mouth and washed his nose by putting water in and blowing it out, and washed his face and forearms. Then he poured water over his head three times, then he poured water over the remainder of his body, then he moved from where he was and washed his feet",
