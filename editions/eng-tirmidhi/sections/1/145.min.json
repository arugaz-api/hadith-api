He said: \"When Allah mentioned Wudu in His Book, He said: \"So wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows.\" And He said about Tayammum: \"And rub therewith your faces and hands\" And He said: \"And the male thief and the female thief; cut off their hands.\" So the Sunnah for cutting is the two hands. So it is only the face and the hands, meaning, Tayammum","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":145}}}
