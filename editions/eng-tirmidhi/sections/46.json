And whoever covers (the faults) of a Muslim, Allah covers him in the world and in the Hereafter. And whoever makes things easy for one in dire straits, Allah makes things easy for him in the world and the Hereafter. Allah is helping as long as the (His) Slave is helping his brother. And whoever takes a path to gain knowledge, Allah makes a path to Paradise easy for him. And no people sit in a Masjid reciting Allah's Book, studying it among themselves, except that tranquility descends upon them and they are enveloped in the mercy, and surrounded by the angels. And whoever is slow in his deeds, his lineage shall not speed him up",
