For, if he does not find any meat you'll have broth; and it is one of the two meats.\" And there are narrations on this topic from Abu Dharr. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Gharib, we do not know of it except through this route, as a narration of Muhammad bin Fada', who is Muhammad bin Fada' Al-Mu'abbar, and he has been criticized by Sulaiman bin Harb. 'Alqamah bin 'Abdullah is the brother of Bakr bin 'Abdullah Al-Muzani",
