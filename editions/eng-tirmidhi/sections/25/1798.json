    "text": "Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: From Maimunah that a mouse fell in some cooking fat and died. So the Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about that and he said: \"Remove it (the mouse) and what was around it and then eat it (the fat).\" He said: There are something on this topic from Abu Hurairah. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. This Hadith has been related from Az-Zuhri, from 'Ubaidullah, from Ibn 'Abbas, saying: \"The Prophet (ﷺ) as asked\" and they did not mention Maimunah in it. The narration of Ibn 'Abbas from Maimunah is more correct. Ma'mar reported similar from Az-Zuhri, from Sa'eed bin Al-Musayyab, from Abu Hurairah, from the Prophet (ﷺ). But this hadith is not preserved. He said: I heard Muhammad bin Isma'il saying: \"The Hadith of Ma'mar from Az-Zuhri, from Sa'eed bin al-Musayyab, from Abu Hurairah, from the Prophet (ﷺ)\" - and he mentioned in it: 'That he was asked about it, so he said: \"When it (the coking fat) is solid then remove it (the mouse) and what was around it. And when it is liquid then do not use it.'\" This is a mistake. Ma'mar made a mistake with it. And he said: What is correct is the narration of Az-Zuhri from 'Ubaidullah, from Ibn 'Abbas, and Maimunah",
