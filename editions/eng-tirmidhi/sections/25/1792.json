    "text": "Narrated Khuzaimah bin Jaz': \"I asked the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) about eating badger. He said: 'Does anyone eat badger?' So I asked him about eating wolf' He said: 'Does anyone who has any good in him eat wolf?'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] The chain for this Hadith is not strong. We do not know of it except as a narration of Isma'il bin Muslim from 'Abdul-Karim Abi Umayyah. Some of the people of Hadith have criticized Isma'il and 'Abdul Karim Abi Umayyah. And he is 'Abdul-Karim bin Qais, who is Ibn Abi Al-Mukhariq. While 'Abdul-Karim bin Malik Al-Jazari is trustworthy",
