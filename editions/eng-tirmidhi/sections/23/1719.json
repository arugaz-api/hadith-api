    "text": "Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab: \"The wealth of Banu An-Nadir was among the spoils of war which Allah granted upon His Messenger (ﷺ) which the Muslims did not gain with the rush of their horses nor camel. So it was purely for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would set aside a year's worth of expenditure for his family, then he would use what remained of it for horses and weapons to be used in Allah's cause.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Sufyan bin 'Uyainah reported this Hadith from Ma'mar, from Ibn Shihab",
