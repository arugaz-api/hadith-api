    "text": "Narrated Shumair:that Abyad bin Hammal visited the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who asked him to set aside a reserve of salt(a mine). So he reserved it for him. As he was turning away, a man in the gathering said: \"Do you know what you reserved for him ? You merely reserved stagnant water for him.\" He (Shumair) said: \"So he left him.\" He (Shumair) said: \"So he asked him (the Prophet (ﷺ)) about making a private pasture of Arak (a type of tree).\" He said: \"As long as it is not harmed by the hooves of the camels.\" So I (At-Tirmidhi) recited that before Qutaibah and he said: \"Yes\".
