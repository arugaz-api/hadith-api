Then he passed the kettled and ordered that they be weighed, then he distributed it between them and equated a camel to ten sheep.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported it from his father, from 'Abayah, from his grandfather Rafi' bin Khadij, and he did not mention \"from his father\" in it. This was narrated to us by Mahmud bin Ghailan (who said:) \"Waki' narrated it to us from Sufyan.\" And this is more correct. 'Abayah bin Rifa'ah heard from his grandfather Rafi' bin Khadij. He said: There are narrations on this topic from Tha'labah bin Al-Hakam, Anas, Abu Rihanah, Abu Ad-Darda, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samurah, Zaid bin Khalid, Jabir, Abu Hurairah, and Abu Ayyub","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":63}}}
