Then, upon our departure, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'I ordered you to burn so-and-so, and so-and-so with fire, and indeed, none punishes with fire except Allah. So if you see them, then kill them.'\" There are narrations on this topic from Ibn 'Abbas and Hamzah bin 'Amr Al-Aslami. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Abu Hurairah is a Hasan Sahih Hadith. This is acted upon according to the people of knowledge. In this Hadith, Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned a man (narrating) between Sulaiman bin Yasar and Abu Hurairah. Others reported this Hadith the same as Al-Laith reported it(here, without a man between them). The narration of Al-Laith bin Sa'd is more appropriate and more correct","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":32}}}
