They disliked killing women and children. This is the view of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Ash-Shafi'i. Some of the people of knowledge made an exception for killing the women who had children with them during night attacks, this is the view of Ahmad and Ishaq, they permitted it in night attacks","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":30}}}
