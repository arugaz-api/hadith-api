So his master came, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Sell him to me.' So he purchased him for two black slaves. After this he (ﷺ) would not take the pledge from anyone until he asked him if he was a slave.\" [He said:] There is something on this topic from Ibn 'Abbas. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Jabir is Hasan Gharib Sahih, we do not know of it except as a narration of Abu Az-Zubair",
