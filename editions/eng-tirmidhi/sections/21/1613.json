An-Nu'man bin Muqarrin said: \"I participated (in battles) with the Messenger of Allah (ï·º). So when he did not fight in the beginning if the daytime, he would wait until the sun passed the zenith, and the wind of victory would rage, and victory would descent upon them.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.
