    "text": "Narrated 'Ali: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said that Jibra'il had indeed descended upon him to say to him: \"Tell them - meaning your Companions - to choose regarding the captives of Badr, between either killing them or ransoming the, so that the amount killed by them will correspond similarly to them.\" So they said: \"Ranson, even though some of us may be killed.\" There are narrations on this topic from Ibn Mas'ud, Anas, Abu Barzah, and Jubair bin Mut'im. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib as a narration of Ath-Thawri. We do not know of it except through the report of Za'idah. Abu Usamah reported similar to this from Hisham, from Ibn Sirin, from 'Abidah, from 'Ali, from the Prophet (ﷺ) Ibn 'Awn reported it from Ibn Sirin, from 'Abidah, from 'Ali, from the Prophet (ﷺ) in Mursal form. Abu Dawud Al-Hafiri's ( a narrator in this chain) name is 'Umar bin Sa'd",
