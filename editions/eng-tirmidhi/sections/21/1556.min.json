Ibn 'Abbas wrote to him: \"You wrote to me asking me if the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would fight along with women. He did fight along with them, as they would treat the wounded. They received something from the spoils of war, but as for their share, then he did not fix a share for them.\" There is something on this topic from Anas and Umm 'Atiyyah. This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. This is acted upon according to most of the people of knowledge. It is the view of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Ash-Shafi'i. Some of them said that a share is given to the woman and the boy, and this is the view of Al-Awza'i. Al-Awza'i said: The Prophet (ﷺ) gave a portion to the boys at Khaibar, and the Aimmah of the Muslims gave a portion to every child born in the land of war.\" Al-Awza'i said: \"The Prophet (ﷺ) gave a portion to the women at Khaibar, and that was followed by the Muslims after him.\" This was narrated to us by 'Ali bin Khashram (who said): \"'Eisa bin Yunus narrated this to us from Al-Awza'i.\" The meaning of his saying: \"They received something from the spoils of war\" it is said that he conferred something on them (the women) from the spoils of war","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":11}}}
