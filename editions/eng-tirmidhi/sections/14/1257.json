    "text": "Narrated Habib bin Abi Thabit: From Hakim bin Hizam, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Hakim bin Hizam with a Dinar to buy an animal for Udhiyyah (an animal for sacrifice) for him. He purchases an Udhiyyah which he sold and profited a Dinar from, so he purchased another in its place. And he returned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with Udhiyyah and the Dinar, so he said: 'The sheep is for sacrifice and Dinar is for charity.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] We do not know of the Hadith of Hakim bin Hizam except through this route, and Habib bin Abi Thabit did not hear from Hakim bin Hizam - in my view",
