    "text": "Narrated 'Umarah bin Hadid: From Shakr Al-Ghamidi that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"O Allah bless my Ummah in what they do early (in the day).\" He said: \"Whenever he (ﷺ) would dispatch a military expedition or an army, he would send them in the first part of the day.\" And Sakhr, a man who was a merchant, used to send his goods for trade during the beginning of the day, so he became rich, and his wealth increased. [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from 'Ali, Buraidah, Ibn Mas'ud, Anas, Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, and Jabir. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith is Sakhr Al-Ghamidi is a Hasan Hadith. We do not know of a narration that Sakhr Al-Ghamidi reported from the Prophet (ﷺ) other than this Hadith. Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported this Hadith from Shu'bah, from Ya'la bin 'Ata",
