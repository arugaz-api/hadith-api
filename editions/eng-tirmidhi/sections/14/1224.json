[He said:] There are narrations on this topic from Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Zaid bin Thabit, Sa'd, Jabir, Rafi' bin Khadij, and Abu Sa'eed. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Abu Hurairah is a Hasan Sahih Hadith. Muhaqalah is selling corps for wheat, and Muzabanah is selling dates that are on the date-palm for dried dates. This is acted upon according to the most of the people of knowledge, they disliked sales of Muhaqalah and Muzabanah",
