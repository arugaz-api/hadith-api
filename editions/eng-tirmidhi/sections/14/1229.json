    "text": "Narrated Ibn 'Umar: \"The Prophet (ﷺ) prohibited the sale of Habalil-Habalah.\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Ibn 'Umar is Hasan Sahih Hadith. This is acted upon according to the people of knowledge. And Hababil-Habalah is the offspring of the offspring (of an animal). It is an invalid sale according to the people of knowledge and it is type of Gharar sale. Shu'bah reported this Hadith from Ayyub, from Sa'eed bin Jubair, from Ibn 'Abbas. 'Abdul Wahhab Ath-Thaqafi and others reported it from Ayyub, from Sa'eed bin Jubair and Nafi', from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet (ﷺ), and this is more correct",
