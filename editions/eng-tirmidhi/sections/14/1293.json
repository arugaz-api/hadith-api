He said: 'Spill out the wine, and break the jugs.'\" [He said:] There are narrations on this topic from Jabir, 'Aishah, Abu Sa'eed, Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Umar, and Anas. [Abu 'Eisa said:] The Hadith of Abu Talhah, Ath-Thawri reported this Hadith from As-Suddi, from Yahya bin 'Abbad, from Anas: \"That Abu Talhah was with him\" and this is more correct than the narration of Al-laith (no)",
