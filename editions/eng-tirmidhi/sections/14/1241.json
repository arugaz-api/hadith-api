This is acted upon according to the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others, except for what has been related from Ibn 'Abbas; he did not see any harm in exchanging gold for gold or silver for silver, more for less, when it is done hand in hand, and he said: \"Riba' is only in credit.\" Similar it has been related from some of his companions. It has been related that Ibn 'Abbas changed his opinion when Abu Sa'eed narrated it to him from the Prophet (ﷺ). The first view is more correct. And this is acted upon according to the people of knowledge [among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others]. It is the view of Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq. It has been reported that Ibn Al-Mubarak said: \"There is no difference over exchange",
