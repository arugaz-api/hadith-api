Except that he was a wealthy man so he used to mix with the pople and he would tell his servant to be lenient with the insolvent. So Allah, Mighty and Sublime is He, said: 'We are more worthy of that than him, so be lenient with him.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Abu Al-Yasar is Ka'b bin 'Amr",
