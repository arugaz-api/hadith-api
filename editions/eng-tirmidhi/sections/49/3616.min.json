He said: \"Then he came out, such that when he came close to them, he heard them talking, and he heard what they were saying. So some of them said: 'It's amazing that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has taken a Khalil (close friend) from His creation. He took Ibrahim as a Khalil.' And some of them said: 'That is not more amazing than speaking to Musa, He spoke to him with real speech.' And some said: 'And 'Eisa is the word of Allah and His Spirit.' And some said: 'Adam was chosen by Allah.' So he (ﷺ) came out upon them and said his Salam, and said: 'I have heard your words, and your amazement that Ibrahim is the Khalil of Allah, and he is such, and that Musa is the one spoken to by Allah, and he is such, and that 'Eisa is the spirit of Allah and His Word, and he is such, and that Adam was chosen by Allah, and he is such. Indeed I am the beloved of Allah and I am not boasting, and I am the carrier of the Banner of Praise on the Day of Judgement, and I am not boasting. And I am the first intercessor, and the first to have intercession accepted from him on the Day of Judgement, and I am not boasting. And I am the first to shake the rings of Paradise (meaning on the gates of Paradise) and so Allah will open it for me and admit me into it. And with me will be the poor people from the believers, and I am not boasting. And I am the most noble among the first ones and the last ones, and I am not boasting","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":12}}}
