Once I had tended to my need, I said: 'What is this that you were covering up?' So he uncovered it, and I found it was Hasan and Husain [peace be upon them] upon his hips. So he said: 'These are my two sons, and the sons of my daughter. O Allah! Indeed, I love them, so love them, and love those who love them",
