So when I would ask Ja'far bin Abi Talib, he would not answer me until he would go with me to his place and say to his wife: 'O Asma, give us some food.' Once she had given us some food, he would answer me. And Ja'far used to love the poor and sit with them, and speak with them, and they would speak with him, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to call him Abu Al-Masakin (the Father of the Poor)","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":165}}}
