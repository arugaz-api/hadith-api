    "text": "Narrated Ibrahim bin Muhammad, one of the offspring of 'Ali bin Abi Talib:said: \"When 'Ali [may Allah be pleased with him] described the Prophet (ﷺ) he would say: 'He was not extremely tall (Mummaghit), nor was he extremely short (Mutaraddid), and he was of medium height in relation to the people. The wave of his hair was not completely curly (Qatat), nor straight, but it was in between. He did not have a large head, nor a small head (Mukaltham), his face was round and a blended-white color (Mushrab), his eyes were dark black (Ad'aj), his eye-lashes were long (Ahdab). He was big-boned and broad shouldered (Al-Katad), his body hair was well-placed, and he had a Masrubah, his hands and feet were thick (Shathn). When he walked he walked briskly (Taqalla'), he leaned forward as if he was walking on a decline (Sabab). And if he turned his head, his body turned as well, between his two shoulders was the seal of Prophethood, and he was the seal of the Prophets. He was the most generous of people [in hand, and the most big-hearted of them] in breast. He was the most truthful of people in speech, the softest of them in nature, and the most noble of them in his relations ('Ishrah). Whoever saw him for the first time (Badihah) would fear him, and whoever got to know him, loved him. The one who tried to describe him would have to say: 'I have not seen before him or after him anyone who resembles him (ﷺ)",
