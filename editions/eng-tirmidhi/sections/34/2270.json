    "text": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said:\"When time draws near, the dreams of a believer will hardly ever fail to come true, and the most truthful of them in dreams will be the truest in speech among them. The dream of a Muslim is a portion among the forty-six portions of Prophet-hood. And dreams are of three types: The righteous dream which is good news from Allah, dreams in which the Shaithan frightens someone, and dreams about something that has happened to the man himself. So when one of you sees what he dislikes, then he should get up and spit, and not tell any of the people- he said:- and I like the fetters in a dream while I dislike the iron collar.\" And the interpretation of fetters is being firm in the religion",
