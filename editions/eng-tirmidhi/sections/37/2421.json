    "text": "Sulaim bin 'Amir narrated from Al-Miqdad, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) who said:\"I heard the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) saying: 'On the Day of Judgement, the sun will be drawn near the servants, until it has come a mile or two (away).'\" Sulaim bin 'Amir said: \" I do not know if it is miles that refer to distance on the land, or Al-Mil which is used to apply Kuhl for the eyes.\" He (the Prophet (s.a.w)): \"The sun will melt them, until they will be in sweat according to their deeds. Among them one will be covered up to his ankles, and among them will be one who is covered up to his knees, and among them will be one who is covered up to his waist, and among them will be one who is bridled with it.' I saw the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) indicating with his hand toward his mouth, meaning that one would be bridled with it.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. There are narrations on this topic from Abu Sa'eed and Ibn 'Umar",
