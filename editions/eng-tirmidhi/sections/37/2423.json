    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said:\"The people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection bare-foot, naked and uncircumcised as they were created.\" Then he recited: \"As we begin the first creation, we shall repeat it: A promise binding upon Us. Truly We shall do it. And the first of people to be clothed will be Ibrahim. Among my companions will be some men who are taken to the right and to the left. I will say: 'O my Lord! My companions!' It will be said: 'You do not know what they innovated after you, they continued to be apostates since you parted from them.' So I will say as the righteous worshipper said: If you punish them, they are your slaves, and if You forgive them, indeed You, only You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.\" (Another chain) and he mentioned similarly. [Ab√º 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih",
