    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas narrated :\"When the Prophet (s.a.w) was taken for the Night Journey, he passed by a Prophet, and, some Prophets and with them were some people, and a Prophet, and some Prophets and with them was a group of people, and a Prophet, and some Prophets and with them there was no one. Until he passed by a large multitude. (The Prophet (s.a.w)said: ) I said: 'Who is this?' It was said: 'Musa and his people. But raise your head and look.' There was a large multitude that covered the horizon, from one side to the other. It was said: 'These people are your Ummah, and there are seventy thousand besides these from your Ummah that shall enter Paradise without a reckoning.' So he went inside, and they did not question him, and he gave no explanation to them. (Some of them) said: 'We are them.' Others said: 'They are the children who were born upon the Fitrah and Islam.' So the Prophet (s.a.w) came out and said: 'They are those who do not get themselves cauterized, nor seek Ruqyah, nor read omens, and upon their Lord they rely.' So 'Ukashah bin Mihsan stood and said: 'Am I among them O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Yes.' Then another one stood up and said: 'Am I among them?' So he said \"Ukashah has preceded you to it.'\" Other chains report similar narrations",
