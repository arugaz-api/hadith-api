When we are with the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) we remember the Fire and Paradise as if we are looking at them with the naked eye. But when we return we busy ourselves with our wives and livelihood and we forget so much.” He(Abu Bakr) said: “By Allah! The same thing happens to me. Let us go to the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w).” (Hanzalah said:) “So he went.\" When the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) saw him, he said: “What is wrong with you O Hanzalah?” He said: “Hanzalah has become a hypocrite O Messenger of Allah! When we are with you we remember the Fire and Paradise as if we can see them with the naked eye. But when we return we are busy with our wives and livelihood, and we forget so much.” He said: “So the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'If you were to abide in the state that you are in when you are with me, then the Angels would shake hands with you in your gatherings, and upon your bedding, and in your paths. But O Hanzalah! There is a time for this and a time for that.'” (Sahih)","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":100}}}
