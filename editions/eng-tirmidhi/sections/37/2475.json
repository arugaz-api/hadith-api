    "text": "Jabir bin 'Abdullah narrated:\"The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) dispatched us, and there were three-hundred of us. We were carrying our provisions on our shoulders. Then our provisions ran out such that each man among us could eat only a date per day.\" It was said to him: \"O Abu 'Abdullah! How could one date be enough for a man?'\" He said: \"We realized its value when we did not even have that. Then we came to the sea where we saw a whale that the sea had tossed (on the shore). So we ate as much as we liked from it for eighteen days.\" Other chains report similar narrations",
