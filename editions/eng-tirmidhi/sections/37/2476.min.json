They said: 'O Messenger of Allah! On that day we will be better than we are today, devoting ourselves to worship, satisfied with our good fortune.' So the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'No, today you are better than you will be on that day","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":62}}}
