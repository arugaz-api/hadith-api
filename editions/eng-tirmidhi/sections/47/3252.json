He said: 'After everything that had happened to him he had changed due to the punishment and the beatings, and now he was living in isolation. So I said: \"All praise is due to Allah O Bilal! I have seen you passing you by us holding your nose, and it was not from the dust! And today you are in this state.' So he said: 'Where are you from?' I said: 'From Banu Murrah bin 'Abbad.'

He said: 'My father, Abu Burdah narrated from his father Abu Musa, that the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: \"No worshiper suffers a calamity nor what is worse than that or less, except due to a sin, and what Allah pardons as a result of it is more.\" He (Abu Musa) said: \"And he recited: And whatever misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned (42:)",
