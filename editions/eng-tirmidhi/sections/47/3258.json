He said: 'None of us accompanied him. One night, while he was in Makkah, we could not find him. We said: \"He has been murdered [or] snatched, what has happened to him?\" So we spent the worst night a people could spend until the morning' or 'it was about dawn when we saw him coming from the direction of Hira.' He said: 'They told him about what they had went through.'\" \"So he (ﷺ) said: 'Someone from the Jinn came to invite me, so I went to them to recite for them.' He said: \"So we went and saw their tracks and the traces of their camp fire.'\" Ash-Sha'bi said: \"They asked him about their provisions - and they were Jinns of Mesopotamia - so he said: 'Every bone upon which Allah's name has not been mentioned, that falls into your hands, and every dropping of dung is fodder for your beasts.'\" So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Do not perform Istinja with them for indeed they are provisions for your brothers among the Jinns",
