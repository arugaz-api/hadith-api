    "text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah:that the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: \"Indeed, the honorable, the son of the honorable, the son of the honorable, the son of the honorable: Yusuf bin Ya'qub bin Ishaq bin Ibrahim.\" He said: \"And if I were to have remained in the prison as long as Yusuf, then the messenger came, I would have accepted.\" Then he recited: When the messenger came to him, he said: \"Return to your king and ask him: 'What happened to the women who cut their hands? (12:50)' He said: \"May Allah have mercy upon Lut, certainly he used to lean toward powerful support, since he said: \"Would that I had strength to overpower you, or that I could betake myself to some powerful support (11:80).\" So Allah did not send a Prophet after him except among a high ranking family (Dhirwah) among his people.\" (Another chain) except that he said: \"Allah did not send a Prophet after him except among a wealthy family (Tharwah) among his people.\" Muhammad bin 'Amr said: \"Ath-Tharwah is riches and power. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This is more correct than the narration of AlFadl bin Must, (a narrator in the chain of no. 3116) and this Hadith is Hasan",
