Your Companions were defeated today.’ He said: ‘In what were they defeated?’ He said: ‘Some Jews asked them if their Prophet knew how many keepers are there in Jahannam.’ He said: ‘So what did they say?’ He said: ‘They said: “We do not know until we ask our Prophet.” He said: ‘Are a people defeated who are asked about something that they do not know, merely because they said, “We do not know until we ask our Prophet?” Rather, there (people) did ask their Prophet, they said: “Show us Allah plainly.” I should ask the enemies of Allah about the Darmak.’ So when they came to him they said: ‘O Abul-Qasim! How many keepers are there in Jahannum?’ He said: ‘This and that many.’ One time ten, and one time nine. They said: ‘Yes.’ He said to them: ‘What is the dirt of Paradise?’” He said: “They were silent for a while, then they said: ‘Is it bread O Abul-Qasim?’ So the Prophet said: ‘The bread is made of Ad-Darmak.’”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":379}}}
