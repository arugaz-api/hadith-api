One day revelation was coming to him, he faced the Qiblah, raised his hands and said: 'O Allah! Increase us, do not diminish us. Favor us, do not withhold from us, make us pleased and be pleased with us.' He (ﷺ) said: 'Ten Ayah were revealed to me, whoever abides by them shall enter Paradise (and they are): 'Successful indeed are the believers...' until the completion of ten Ayat (23:1-10).\" (Another route) from AzZuhri with this chain. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This is more correct than the first narration. I heard Ishaq bin Mansur saying: \"Ahmad bin Hanbal, 'Ali bin AlMadini, and Ishaq bin Ibrãhim reported this Hadith from 'AbdurRazzaq, from Yunus bin Sulaim, from Yunus bin Yazid from AzZuhri.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] Only those who heard from 'Abdur-Razzaq early mentioned in it: \"From Yunus bin Yazid\", while some of them did not mention in it: \"From Yunus bin Yazid.\" And whoever mentioned \"From Yunus bin Yazid\" then he was more correct. Sometimes 'Abdur-Razzaq would mention Yunus bin Yazid in this Hadith and sometimes he would not mention him. [When he did not mention Yunus, then it is Mursal]","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":225}}}
