He said: ‘They were forced from their forts.’ And they were ordered to cut down the date-pals, that caused some hesitation in their chests, so the Muslims said: “We cut some of them, and we left some of them, so let us ask the Messenger of Allah is we are to be rewarded for those that we cut down, and if we will be burdened for what we left?” So Allah [Most High] revealed the Ayah: What you cut down of the Linah, or you left of them standing on their trunks.”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":355}}}
