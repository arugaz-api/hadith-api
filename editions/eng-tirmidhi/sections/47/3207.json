They said: 'He married his wife's son, so Allah revealed: 'Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Last of the Prophets (33:40).' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had taken (adopted) him as a son when he was small, and he remained being called 'Zaid bin Muhammad' until he grew up to adulthood, then Allah revealed: 'Call them by their fathers, then your brothers in religion and your Mawali (33:5). (Say) So-and-so, the Mawla of so-and-so, and; So-and-so, the brother of so-and-so. 'That is more just with Allah' meaning that doing that is more just to Allah",
