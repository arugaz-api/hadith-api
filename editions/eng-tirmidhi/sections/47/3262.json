    "text": "Narrated Malik bin Anas:from Zaid bin Aslam, from his father who said: \"I heard 'Umar bin Al-Khattab [may Allah be pleased with him] saying: 'We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during one of his journeys when I said something to him but he was silent. Then I said something again but he was silent. I quickened my pace of mount to go to the other wise. I said: \"May your mother lose you O Ibn Al-Khattab! You pestered the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) three times, each time he did not reply to you! You deserve that something be revealed about you in the Qur'an.'\" He ('Umar) said: \"It was not long before I heard a voice calling me.' So I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: \"O Ibn Al-Khattab! A Surah was revealed to me last night which is dearer to me than what the sun rises upon: Verily, We have given you a manifest victory (48:)",
