    "text": "Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:\"Abu Talib fell ill, so the Quraish went to see him, and the Prophet (ﷺ) went to see him. There was a gathering there with Abu Talib, so Abu Jahl stood up enraged, to prevent him (the Prophet (ﷺ) from entering).\" He said: \"He complained to Abu Talib. So he (Abu Talib) said: 'O my nephew! What is it that you want from your people?' He said: 'I only want one word from them, for which, if they were to say it, then the Arabs will become their followers, and the non-Arabs will pay Jizyah to them.' He said: 'One word?' He replied: 'One word.' So he said: 'O uncle! Let them say La Ilaha Illallah' so they replied: 'One God? We have not heard (the like) of this in the religion of these later days. This is nothing but an invention.'\" He said: \"So the (following) was revealed in the Qur'an about them: 'Sad. By the Qur'an full of reminding. Those who disbelieve are in false pride and opposition...' up to His saying: 'We have not heard (the like) of this in the religion of these later days. This is nothing but an invention (38:)",
