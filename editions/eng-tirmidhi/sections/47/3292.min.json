And in Paradise there is a tree under whose shade a rider can travel for one hundred years without stopping. Recite if you wish: And in shade extended. And the space occupied by a whip in Paradise is better than the world and whatever is in it. Recite if you wish: And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception.”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":344}}}
