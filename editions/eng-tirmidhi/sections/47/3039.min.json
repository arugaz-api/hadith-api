So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'O Abu Bakr! Shall I recite to you an Ayah revealed to me?' I said: 'Of course O Messenger of Allah!' So he recited it to me, and I do not know except that I found it as a fatal blow, but I repressed it. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'What is bothering you O Abu Bakr?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! May my father and my mother be your ransom! Which of us has not done evil - and yet we shall be recompensed for what we have done?' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'As for you O Abu Bakr, and the believers, they will be recompensed for that in the world until they meet Allah and they have no sins. As for the others, then that will be collected for them until they are recompensed for it on the Day of Judgement","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":91}}}
