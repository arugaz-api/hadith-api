He said: “These are men who submitted (to Islam) in Makkah, and they wanted to come to the Prophet but their wives and children refused to allow them to come to the Messenger of Allah. So when they came to the Messenger of Allah, they saw that the people had gained such understanding in the religion that they wanted to punish them (their families). So Allah revealed the Ayah: O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you; therefore beware of them!”",
