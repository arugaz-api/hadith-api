The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Either you produce proof, or you will receive the legal punishment on your back.'\" He said: \"Hilal said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)! If one of us saw a man over his wife, should he go and search for witnesses?' The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on saying: 'Either you produce proof, or you will receive the legal punishment on your back.'\" He said: \"Hilal then said, 'By Him Who sent you with the Truth and Allah will reveal to you what will save my back from the legal punishment.' Then (the following) was revealed: And for those who accuse their wives, but have not witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies by Allah that he is one of those who speak the truth (24:6-9). He recited it until he reached: 'And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) was saying: 'Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so, will either of you repent?' Then the woman got up and took the oaths, and when she was about to take the fifth one; That the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth', the people stopped her and said to her: 'It will definitely bring about Allah's curse upon you (if you are guilty).'\" Ibn 'Abbas said 'So she hesitated, and recoiled so much so, that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But she said: 'I will not dishonor my family for the rest of their days.' The Prophet (ﷺ) then said: 'Watch her, if she delivers a child with eyes that appear to have Kuhl on them, big hips, and fat shins then it is Sharik bin Sahma's child.' (Later) she gave birth to a child fitting that description. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'If it had not been settled in the Book of Allah [the Mighty and Sublime], I would punish her severely","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":231}}}
