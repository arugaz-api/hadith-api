    "text": "Narrated ['Abdullah] bin Mas'ud:\"When the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) reached Sidrat Al-Muntaha\" He said: 'There terminates everything that ascends from the earth, and everything that descends from above. So there Allah gave him three, which He did not give to any Prophet before him: He made fiver prayers obligatory upon him, He gave him the last Verses of Surat Al-Baqarah, and He pardoned the grave sins for those of his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.' Ibn Mas'ud said regarding the Ayah: \"When that covered the Sidrah which did cover it! (53:16)\" he said: \"The sixth Sidrah in heavens.\" Sufyan said: \"Golden butterflies\" and Sufyan indicated with his hand in a fluttering motion. Others besides Malik bin Mighwal said: \"There terminates the creatures' knowledge, there is no knowledge for them of what is above that",
