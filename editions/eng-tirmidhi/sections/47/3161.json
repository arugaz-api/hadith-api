    "text": "Narrated Abu Hurairah:that the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: \"When Allah loves a slave He calls Jibra'il, (saying): 'Indeed I love so-and-so, so love him.'\" He said: \"So he calls out in the heavens. Then love for him descends among the people of the earth. That is as in the saying of Allah: Verily, those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious will grant love for them (19:96). And when Allah hates a slave He calls out to Jibra'il, (saying): 'Indeed I hate so-and-so.' So he calls out in the heavens. Then hatred for him descends upon the earth",
