He said: 'That he gives him a loan and then he makes a sale to him greater then it's actual worth. And, it carries the meaning of him loaning it to him in exchange for something (as collateral), so he says: 'If you are unable to pay it (the loan), the it (the collateral) will be a sale for you.' Ishaq [bin Rahuwyah] said as he said. And I said to Ahmad: 'What about selling what one does not possess?' He said: 'To me it does not apply except in cases of food - meaning one has not taken possession of it.' And Ishaq said the same for all of what is measured or weighed. Ahmad said: 'When he says: \"I will sell you this garment, with the condition that I am the tailor for it, and I am the one who bleaches it.' This is an example of two conditions in one sale. But if he says: \"I am selling it to you with the condition that I am its tailor,\" then there is no harm in it. And, if he said: \"I am selling it to you with the condition that I am the one who bleaches it\" then there is no harm in it, because this is only one condition.' And Ishaq said as he said",

This is the saying of [Sufyan] Ath-Thawri. This has been reported from Malik bin Anas, and it has been reported from Ibn al-Mubarak that he said: \"How could this be refuted ?\" And the Hadith about it from the Prophet (ﷺ) is Sahih, and it strenghtens this view.

If he chooses to agree to the sale, then he does not have the choice to cancel the sale after then, even if they did not separate. This is how Ash-Shafi'i and others explained it. And what strenghtens the view of those who said that the separation refers to them parting, (and) it does not refer to speech, is the (following) Hadith of 'Abdullah bin 'Amr from the Prophet (ﷺ)",

And its meaning is that when the debt of one of you is transferred then agree. Some of the people of knowledge said when a man is offered to transfer his debt to a rich man and he does so, then the transferor is free of it, he is not to seek its return from the transferor. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq. Some of the people of knowledge said: \"When this wealth could not be collected due to bankruptcy of the one it was transferred to, then he may seek its return to the first one.\" They argue this view with the saying of 'Uthman and others, when they said: \"There is nothing due on a Muslim's wealth that is lost.\" Ishaq said: \"The meaning of this Hadith: 'There is nothing due on a Muslim's wealth that is lost' this is when a man transfers it to another whom he thinks is wealthy, then he becomes bankrupt, so there is nothing due on the Muslim's wealth that is lost",
