    "text": "Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: \"When the Prophet (ï·º) drank, he would breathe two times.\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Gharib, we do not know of it except as a narration of Rishdin bin Kuraib. He said: I asked [Abu Muhammad] 'Abdullah bin 'Abdur-Rahman about Rishdin bin Kuraib: \"Is he stronger (in narration), or Muhammad bin Kuraib?\" He said: \"Neither are better to me. Rishdin bin Kuraib is preferred over them to me.\" He said: I asked Muhammad bin Isma'il about this, so he said: \"Muhammad bin Kuraib is preferred over Rishdin bin Kuraib.\" To me, the correct view is what Abu Muhammad 'Abdullah bin 'Abdur-Rahman said: Rishdin bin Kuraib is more preferred and he is elder. He lived to see Ibn 'Abbas, and they are brothers, and they both have Munkar narrations in their reports",
