Whoever goes in the second hour then he is like one who gave a cow in charity. Whoever goes in the third hour then he is like the one who have a ram in charity. Whoever goes in the fourth hour then he is like the one who gave a chicken in charity. Whoever goes in the fifth hour, then he is like one who gave an egg in charity. When the Imam comes out, the angels are present listening to the remembrance",
