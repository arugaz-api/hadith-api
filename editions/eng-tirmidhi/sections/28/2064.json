Their leader became ill, and they came to us saying: 'Do you have any medicine?'We said: ' Yes. But you did not entertain us nor have us as guests so we will not do anything until you give us something.' Then they gave sheep for that.\" He said: 'So a man from us began reciting the Opening of the Book (Surat Al-Fatihah) and he was cured. So when we came to the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) we mentioned to him, He said: 'How did you know it was Ruqyah?' And he did not mention any prohibition against it,and he said: 'Eat , and assign me a share among you from them (Sheep)",
