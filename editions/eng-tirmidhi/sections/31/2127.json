    "text": "Ibrahim At-Taimi narrated from his father: \"'Ali delivered a Khutbah for us in which he said: 'Whoever claims that we have some book to read other than Allah's Book and this paper, which include camel's ages and things related to (relatiation for) wounds, then he has lied.\" And he said in it: \"Al-Madinah is sacred, what is between 'Air to Thawr, so whoever introduces in it any innovation or shelters an innovator then upon him is the curse of Allah, the angels, and all people. On the Day of Judgment, Allah will not accept his compulsory nor optional good deeds. And whoever claims someone else to be his father, or claims Wala' for someone other than his Mawali, then upon him is the curse of Allah, the angels, and the people; his compulsory and optional good deeds shall not be accepted. The covenants of the Muslims are one, it covers the rest of them. [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. Some of them reported it similarly from Al-A'mash, from Ibrahim At-Taimi, from Al-Harith bin Suwaid from 'Ali. [Abu 'Eisa said:] It has been reported through more than one route from 'Ali [from the Prophet (ï·º]",
