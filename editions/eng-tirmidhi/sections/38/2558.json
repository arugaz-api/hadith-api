It shall be stood between Paradise and the Fire, and then slaughtered while they watch. If anyone were to die of joy, then surely the people of Paradise and the Fire, and then slaughtered while they watch. If anyone were to die of joy, then surely the people of Paradise would die, and if anyone were to die of grief, then surely the people of the Fire would die",
