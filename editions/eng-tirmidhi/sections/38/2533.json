    "text": "Abdullah bin Mas'ud narrated that the Prophet (s.a.w) said:\"Indeed, a woman from the wives of the people of Paradise, the whiteness of her shin is visible through seventy garments until her marrow is seen, and that is because Allah, he Exalted, says: As if they are corundum and Marjan. So, as for the corundum, it is a stone that if you were to enter a wire through it, then you polished its cloudiness away, you would surely be able to see it through it.\" Another chain reports a similar narration",
