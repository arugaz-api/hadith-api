He found him in his last breaths, so he took him and put him on his lap and cried. Abdur-Rahman said to him: 'You cry? Didn't you prohibit (your followers) from crying?' He said: 'No. But I prohibited two foolish immoral voices: A voice during a calamity while clawing at one's face and tearing one's clothes, and Shaitan's scream.'\" And there is more that is stated in the Hadith",
