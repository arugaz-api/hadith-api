Abu hurairah blows his nose in linens! I saw a time when I would pass out between the mimbar of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) and the dwelling of 'Aishah from overwhelming hunger. Someone came and placed his foot on my neck thinking that I was a mad man, but I was not crazy, It was nothing but hunger.\" (sahih)",
