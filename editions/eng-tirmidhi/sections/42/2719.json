But there was no one who would accept us. So we went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he brought us to his family where there were three goats. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Milk these.' We milked them, and each person drank his share, and we put aside a share for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came during the night and gave the Salam such that it would not wake the sleeping person, and the one who was awake could hear it. Then he went to the Masjid to per form Salat. Then he went for his drink and drank it",
