    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:\"While we were with the Prophet, a man stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, a black boy has been born to me.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'How did that happen?' He said: 'I do not know.' He said: 'Do you have camels?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'What color are they?' He said: 'Red.' He said: 'Are there any gray camels among them?' He said: 'There are some gray camels among them.' He said: 'Where do they come from?' He said: 'I do not know, O Allah's Messenger! Perhaps it is hereditary.' He said: 'Perhaps this is also hereditary.'
