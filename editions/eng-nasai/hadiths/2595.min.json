He turned to me and said: 'Whoever wants to be independent of means, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will make him independent. Whoever wants to refrain from asking, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will help him to refrain. Whoever wants to be content with his lot, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will suffice him. Whoever asks when he has something worth one Uqiyah, then he is being too demanding. 'I said: 'My she-camel Al-Yaqutah is worth more than and Uqiyah,' so I came back and did not ask him for anything","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":161}}}
