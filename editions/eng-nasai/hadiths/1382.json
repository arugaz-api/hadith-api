    "text": "It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that :'Umar bin al-Khattab saw a Hullah and said: \"O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why don't you buy this and wear it on Fridays and when meeting the delegations when they come to you?\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"This is worn by one who has no share in the Hereafter.\" Then something similar was brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he gave a Hullah to 'Umar from it. 'Umar said: \"O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), have you given me this when you said what you said about the Hullah of 'Utarid?\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"I have not given it to you to wear it.\" So 'Umar gave it to an idolator brother of his in Makkah",
