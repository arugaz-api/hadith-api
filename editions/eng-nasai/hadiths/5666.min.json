There was a man among those who came before you who was a devoted worshipper. An immoral woman fell in love with him. She sent her slave girl to him, saying: We are calling you to bear witness. So he set out with her slave girl, and every time he entered a door, she locked it behind him, until he reached a beautiful woman who has with her a boy and a vessel of wine. She said: 'By Allah, I did not call you to bear witness, rather I called you to have intercourse with me, or to drink a cup of this wine, or to kill this boy.' He said: 'Pour me a cup of this wine.' So she poured him a cup. He said: 'Give me more.' And soon he had intercourse with her and killed the boy. So avoid Khamr, for by Allah faith and addiction to Khamr cannot coexist but, one of them will soon expel the other","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih Muquf"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Muquf"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":128}}}
