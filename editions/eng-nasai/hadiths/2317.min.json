But whoever does good of his own accord means feeding another poor person. This is not abrogated, and it is bette for him. And: that \"you fast is better for you\" means there is no concession regarding this except for those who are not able to fast, or who are incurably sick","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":228}}}
