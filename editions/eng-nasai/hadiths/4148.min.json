{"author":"Sunan an Nasai","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4148,"arabicnumber":4148,"text":"It was narrated that Malik bin Aws bin Al-Hadathan said:\"Al-Abbas and Ali came to 'Umar with a dispute. Al-Abbas said: 'Pass judgment between him and I.' the people said: 'Pass judgment between them.' 'Umar said: 'I will not pass judgment between them. They know that the Messenger of Allah said: We are not inherited from, what we leave behind is charity. He said: And (in this narration of it) Az-Zuhri said: 'It (the Khumus) was under the control of the Messenger of Allah , and he took provision for himself and for his family from it, and disposed to the rest of it as he disposed of other wealth (belonging to the Muslims). Then Abu Bakr took control of it, then I took control of it after Abu Bakr, and I did with it what he sued to do. Then these two came to me and asked me to give it to them so that they could dispose of it as the Messenger of Allah disposed of it, and as Abu Bakr disposed of it, and as I disposed of it. So I gave it to them and I took promises from them that they would take proper care of it. Then they came to me and this one said. Give me my share from my brothers son: and this one said: Give me my share from my wife. If they want me to give it to them on the condition that they would dispose of it in the same manner as the Messenger of Allah did, and as Abu Bakr did, and as I did, I would give it to them, but if they refuse, then they do not have to worry about it.' Then he said: 'And know that whatever of spoils of war that you may gain, verily, one-fifth of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the near relatives (of the Messenger (Muhammad), (and also) the orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor) and the wayfarer' (Al-Anfal 8:41) this if for them. 'As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqara (poor), and Al-Masakin (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (toward Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah's cause (I.e. for Mujahidun - those fighting in a holy battle)' - this is for them. 'And what Allah gave as booty (Fay') to His Messenger (Muhammad) from them - for this you made no expeditin with either cavalry or camels.' Az-Zuhri said: This applies exclusively to the Messenger of Allah and refers to an 'Arab village called Fadak, and so on. What Allah gave as booty (Fay') to His Messenger (Muhammad) from the people of the townships - it is for Allah, His Messenger (Muhammad), the kindred (of Messenger Muhammad), the orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor), and the wayfarer (And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property And (it is also for) those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith And those who came after them. These is no one left among the Muslims but he has some rights to this wealth, except for some of the slaved whom you own. If I live, if Allah wills, I will give every Muslim his right.\" Or he said: \"His share","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":38,"hadith":16}}}
