He said: 'Come and eat.' I said: 'I am fasting.' He adjured me by Allah to break my fast. I said Subhan-Allah twice. When I saw that he was insisting, I went forward and said: 'Give me what you have.' He said: 'I heard Ibn 'Abbas say: The Messenger of Allah said: 'Fast when you see it (the crescent) and stop fasting when you see it, and if clouds or darkness prevent you from seeing it, then complete the number of days of Shaban, and do not fast ahead of the month, and do not join Ramadan to a day of Shaban","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":100}}}
