The Messenger of Allah said: What is the matter with Ibn Jamil? Was he not poor then Allah made him rich? As for Khalid bin Al-Walid, you are being unfair to Khalid, for he is saving his shields and weapons for the sake of Allah. As for Al-Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib, the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah, it is and obligatory charity for him and he has to pay as much again",
