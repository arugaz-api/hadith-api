    "text": "It was narrated that Jabir bin Abdullah said:\"The Messenger of Allah said: 'There is no owner of camels or cattle or sheep who does not give what is due on them, but he will be made to stand for them on the Day of Resurrection in a flat arena, and those with hooves will trample him with their hooves, and those with horns will gore him with their horns. And on that day there will be none that are hornless or have broken horns.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is due on them?' He said: Lending males for breeding, lending their buckets, and giving them to people to ride in the cause of Allah. And there is no owner of wealth who does not give what is due on it but a bald-headed Shujaa[1]will appear to him on the Day of Resurrection; its owner will flee from it and it will chase him and say to him: This is your treasure which you used to hoard. When he realizes that he cannot escape it he will put his hand in its mouth and it will start to bite it as a stallion bites",
