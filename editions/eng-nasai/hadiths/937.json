    "text": "It was narrated that AbdurRahman bin Abdul-Qari said:\"I heard Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, say: 'I heard Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam reciting Surat Al-Furqan, in a way that I had not been taught, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had taught me. I was about to interrupt him (in his prayer), but I left him alone until he had finished. Then I grabbed him by his garment and brought him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way that you did not teach me.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: 'Recite.' So he recited it in the way that I had heard him recite. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'It was revealed like this.' Then he said to me: 'Recite.' So I recited it and he said: 'It was revealed like this. This Quran has been revealed in seven different modes, so recite as much of the Quran as may be easy for you",
