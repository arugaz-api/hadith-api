{"author":"Sunan an Nasai","hadith":{"hadithnumber":93,"arabicnumber":93,"text":"It was narrated from 'Abd Khair, that 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was brought a chair, and he sat down on it, then he called for a vessel of water which he tilted onto his hand three times, then he rinsed his mouth and nose with one hand, three times, he washed his face three times, washed each forearm three times, and took some of the water and wiped his head. One one occasion (One of the narrators) Shu'bah, indicated (that he wiped) from his forelock to the back of his head, then said:\"I do not know whether he brought his hands back or not. And he washed each foot three times, then he said: 'Whoever would like to see how the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) purified himself, this is how he purified himself.'\" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: \"This is a mistake. What is correct is Khalid bin 'Alqamah, not Malik bin 'Urfutah","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":93}}}
