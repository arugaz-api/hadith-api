    "text": "It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said:\"When Allah created Paradise and Hell, He sent Jibril, peace be upon him, to Paradise and said: 'Look at it and at what I have prepared for its people in it.' He looked at it, then he came back and said: 'By Your Glory, no one will hear of it but he will enter it.' So He commanded that it be surrounded by hardships and said: 'Go and look at it and at what I have prepared for its people in it.' He looked at it and saw that it had been surrounded with hardships. He (Jibril) said: 'By Your Glory, I fear that no one will enter it.' He (Allah) said: 'Go and look at the Fire and at what I have prepared for its people in it.' So he looked at it and parts of it were piled upon other parts. He came back and said: 'By Your Glory, no one will enter it.' So He commanded that it be surrounded with pleasures and said: 'Go and look at it.' So he looked at it and saw that it was surrounded with pleasures. He came back and said: 'By Your Glory, I fear that no one will be saved from it and all will enter it",
