    "text": "Hilal bin Khabbab said:\"I asked Sa'eed bin Jubair about a man who performs Hajj and stipulates a condition. He said: 'Conditions are something that people do among themselves.' I narrated the Hadith of 'Ikrimah to him, and he narrated to me from Ibn 'Abbas, that Duba'ah bint Az-Zubair bin 'Abdul-Muttalib came to the Prophet, and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I want to perform Hajj, so what should I say?' He said: 'Say: Labbaik Allahumma! Labbaika wa mahilli min al-ardihayth tahbisuni (Here I am, O Allah, Here I am, and I shall exit Ihram at any place where You decree that I cannot proceed.)\" And whatever condition you stipulate will be accepted by your Lord",
