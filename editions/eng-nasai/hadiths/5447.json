    "text": "It was narrated that 'Amr bin Maimun Al-Awdi said:\"Sa'd used to teach his children these words as a teacher teaches his students, and he said that the Messenger of Allah [SAW] used to seek refuge by means of them at the end of every prayer: 'Allahumma inni a'udhu bika minal-bukhli, wa a'udhu bika minal-jubni, wa a'udhu bika an uradda ila ardhalil-'umuri, wa a'udhu bika min fitnatid-dunya, wa a'udhu bika min 'adhabil-qabr (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from miserliness, and I seek refuge in You from cowardice, and I seek refuge in You from reaching the age of senility, and I seek refuge in You from the trials of this world, and I seek refuge in You from the torment of the grave.) So I narrated that to Mus'ab and he said that he told the truth",
