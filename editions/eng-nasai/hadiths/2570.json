    "text": "It was narrated from Zaid bin Zibyan, and attributed to Abu Dharr, that the Prophet said:\"There are three whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves, and three whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, hates. As for those whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves: A man who comes to some people and asks (to be given something) for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and not for the sake of their relationship, but they do not give him. So one man stayed behind and gave to him in secret, and no one knew of his giving except Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and the one to whom he gave it. People who travel all night until sleep becomes dearer to them than anything that may be equivalent to it, so they lay down their heads (and slept). Then a man among them got up and started praying to Me and beseeching Me, reciting MY Ayat. And a man who was on a campaign and met the enemy and they fled, but he went forward (pursuing them) until he was killed or Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, granted victory to him. And three whom Allah hates are the old man who commits Zina, the poor man who shows off, and the rich man who is unjust",
