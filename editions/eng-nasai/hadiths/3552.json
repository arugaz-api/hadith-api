    "text": "Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Utbah narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin 'Uthman divorced the daughter of Sa'eed bin Zaid -whose mother was Hamnah bint Qais- irrevocably. Her maternal aunt Fatimah bint Qais told her to move from the house of 'Abdullah bin 'Amr. Marwan heard of that, so he sent word to her, telling her to go back to her home until her 'Iddah was over. She sent a word to him telling him that her maternal aunt Fatimah had issued a Fatwa to that effect, and she told her that the Messenger of Allah had issued a Fatwa to her, telling her to move when Abu 'Amr bin Hafs Al-Makhzumi divorced her. Marwan sent Qabisah bin Dhu'aib to Fatimah to ask her about that. She said that she had been married to Abu 'Amr when the Messenger of Allah appointed 'Ali bin Abi Talib as governor of Yemen, and he went out with him, then he sent word to her divorcing her, and that was the final divorce for her. He told her to ask Al-Harith bin Hisham and 'Ayyash for her provisions that her husband had allocated for her. They said:\"By Allah, she is not entitled to any provision. So, she sent to Al-Harith bin Hisham and 'Ayyash asking them for the provisions from us unless she is pregnant, and she has no right to live in our house unless we permit her.\" Fatimah said that she went to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that and he said that they had told the truth. She said: \"I said: 'Where shall I move to, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Move to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum' -who was the blind man, concerning whom Allah rebuked him in His Book. I moved to his house, and I used to take off my outer garments.\" Then the Messenger of Allah married her to Usamah bin Zaid",
