Then Ibn umm Maktum came to him while he was dictating it to me (Zaid) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! If I were able to go for Jihad I would go out for Jihad.' But he was a blind man. Then Allah revealed to His Messenger (ﷺ) - while his thigh was agaisnt my thigh, and (it became so heavy that) I thought my thigh would break, then it was lifted from him, and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: 'Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame).'\" [1] [1] An-Nisa' 4:",
