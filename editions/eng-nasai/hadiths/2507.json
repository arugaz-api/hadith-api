When the command to give Zakah was revealed, he neither told us to do it, not told us not to do it, and we used to do it.\" (Sahih) Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasai) said: Abu 'Ammar's name is 'Arib bin Humaid, and 'Amr bin Shurabbil's Kunyah is Abu Maisarah, and Salamah bin Kuhail contradicted Al-Hakam in his chain, and Al-Hakam is more reliable than Salamah bin Kuhail",
