We did not wake up until the sun had risen. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked the Mu'adhdhin to call the Adhan, then he prayed the two Rak'ahs before Fajr, then he asked him to say the Iqamah, then he led the people in prayer. Then he told us about everything that will happen until the Hour begins",
