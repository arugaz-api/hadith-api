Then he stayed one month on the night when he used to go back home, and he addressed the people and enjoined upon them whatever Allah (SWT) willed. Then he said: 'I used to observe I'tikaf during these ten days, then I decided to spend the last ten days in I'tikaf.

And I saw myself prostrating in water and mud.'\" Abu Sa'eed said: \"It rained on the night of the twenty-first, and the roof of the Masjid leaked over the place where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray. I looked at him when he had finished praying subh and his face was wet with water and mud",
