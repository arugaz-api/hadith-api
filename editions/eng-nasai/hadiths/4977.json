    "text": "It was narrated from Al-Harith bin Hatib that a thief was brought to the Messenger of Allah and he said:\"Kill him.\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, he only stole (something).\" He said: \"Kill him.\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, he only stole (something).\" He said: \"Cut off his hand.\" Then he stole again, and his foot was cut off. Then he stole at the time of Abu Bakr, untilo all his extremities had been cut off. Then he stole a fifth time, and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah knew better about him when he said: 'Kill him.\"' Then he handed him over to some young men of Quraish to kill him, among whom was 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair who liked to be in a position of leadership. He said: \"Put me in charge of them,\" so they put him in charge of them and when he struck him, they would strike him, until they killed him",
