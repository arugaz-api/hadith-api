Permit me to tell you of a statement that the Messenger of Allah said the day after the Conquest of Makkah, which my ears heard, my hear understood, and my eyes saw, when he said it. He (the Prophet) praised Allah, then he said: 'Makkah has been made sacred by Allah, not by the people. It is not permissible for any man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood in it, or to cut its trees. If any one seeks permission to fight in it because the Messenger of Allah fought in it, say to him: Allah allowed his Messenger (to fight therein) but He did not allow you. Rather permission was given to me (to fight therein) for a short period one day, and now its sanctity has been restored as it as before. Let those who are present convey (this mews) to those who are absent","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":259}}}
