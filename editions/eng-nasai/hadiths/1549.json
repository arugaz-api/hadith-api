    "text": "Shu'bah narrated from Mansur who said:\"I heard Mujahid narrating from Abu Ayyash Az-Zuraqi\"- Shu'bah said: \"He had written it for me, and I read it before him, and I heard him narrating it; rather, I even memorized it.\" Ibn Bashshar said: \"I memorized it from the book\"- \"The Prophet (ﷺ) was drawing up ranks facing the enemy in 'Usfan when the idolaters were led by Khalid bin Al-Walid. The Prophet (ﷺ) led them in praying Zuhr. The idolaters said: 'They have a prayer after this that is dearer to them than their wealth and sons.' Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led them in praying 'Asr. He divided them into two rows, behind him. He led them all in bowing, then when they raised their heads he led the row that was closest to him in prostrating, while the others remained standing. When they raised their heads from prostration, the second row prostrated, as they had already bowed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then the front row moved forward, so each of them took the place of his companion. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led them all in bowing, then when they raised their heads from bowing, the row that was closest to him prostrated while the others remained standing, then when they had finished prostrating, the others prostrated, then the Prophet (ﷺ) said the taslim for all of them together",
