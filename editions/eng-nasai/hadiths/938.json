I was about to jump on him while he was praying, but I waited patiently until he said the Salam (at the end of the prayer). When he had said the Salam I grabbed him by his garment and said: 'Who taught you this Surah that I heard you reciting?' He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me it. I said: 'You are lying, by Allah! The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is the one who taught me this Surah that I heard you reciting.' I took him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way that you did not teach me, but you taught me Surat Al-Furqan.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:' Let him go, O Umar. Recite, O Hisham.' So I recited it to him in the way that I had heard him recite. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'It was revealed like this.' Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Recite, O Umar.' So I recited it in the way that he had taught me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'It was revealed like this.' Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'This Quran has been revealed to be recited in seven different modes, so recite as much of the Quran as may be easy for you",
