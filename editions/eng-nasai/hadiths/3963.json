    "text": "Aishah said:\"Shall I not tell you about the Prophet and I?\" We said: \"Yes.\" She said: \"When it was my night, he came in, placed his shoes by his feet, lay down his Rida' (upper garment), and spread his Izar (lower garment) on his bed. As soon as he thought that I had gone to sleep, he put his shoes on slowly and picked up his Rida' slowly. Then he opened the door slowly, went out and shut it slowly. I put my garment over my head, covered myself and put on my Izar (lower garment), and I set out after him until he came to Al-Baqi', raised his hands three times and stood there for a long time. Then he left and I left, he hurried and I hurried, he ran and I ran, and I got there before him and entered (the house).

He said: 'Either you tell me or the All-Aware, All-Knowing will tell me.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you;' and I told him the story. He said: 'You were the black shape I saw in front of me?' I said: 'Yes.'\" She said: \"He gave me a shove in the chest that hurt me and said: 'You thought that Allah and His Messenger would be unfair to you.' She said: 'Whatever people conceal, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, knows it.' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Jibril came to me when you saw (me leave) but he did not enter upon you because you have taken off your garments. So he called me but he concealed himself from you, and I answered him but I concealed it from you. I thought that you had gone to sleep and I did not want to wake you and I was afraid that you would feel lonely. He told me to go to Al-Baqi' and pray for forgiveness for them.'\" Hajjaj bin Muhammad contradicted him (Ibn Wahb), he said: \"From Ibn Juraij, from Ibn Abi Mulaikah, from Muhammad bin Qais",
