When the woman saw that he was not saying anything about her, she sat down. A man among his Companions stood up and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, if you do not want to marry her, then marry me to her.\" He said: \"Do you have anything?\" He said: \"No, by Allah, I do not have anything.\" He said: \"Look, even if it is only an iron ring.\" He went, then he came back and said: \"No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, not even an iron ring, but this is my Izar (lower garment)\" - Sahl said: \"He did not have a Rida' (upper garment)\" - \"she can have half of it.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"What could she do with your Izar? If you wear it, she will not have any of it, and if she wears it, you will not have any of it.\" The man sat down for a long time, then he got up, and the Messenger of Allah saw him leaving, so he ordered that he be called back. When he came, he said: \"What do you know of the Qur'an?\" He said: \"I know Surah such-and-such, and Surah such-and-such,\" and listed them. He said: \"Can you recite them by heart?\" He said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Then I marry you to her on the basis of what you know of the Qur'an","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":144}}}
