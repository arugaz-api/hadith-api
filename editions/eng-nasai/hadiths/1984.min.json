O Allah, give him a house better than his house and a family better than his family and a wife better than his wife, and admit him to Paradise and save him from Hellfire).\" Or he said: \"Wa a'idhhu min 'adhab al-qabr (And protect him from the torment of the grave)","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":167}}}
