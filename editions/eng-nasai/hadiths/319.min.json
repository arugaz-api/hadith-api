You did not pray, but I rolled in the dust then prayed. When we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I told him about that and he said: 'This would have been sufficient for you,' and then Prophet (ﷺ) struck the earth with his hands then blew on them and wiped his face and hands - (one of the narrators) Salamah was uncertain and said: \"I do not know if he said it should be up to the elbows or just the hands.\" - 'Umar said: \"We will let you bear the burden of what you took upon yourself.\" (One of the narrators) Shu'bah said: \"He used to say the hands, face and forearms.\" (Another) Mansur said to him: \"What are you saying?
