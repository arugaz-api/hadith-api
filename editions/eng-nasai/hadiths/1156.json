Then he prostrated and said the takbir, then he raised his head and said the takbir, then he said the takbir when he stood up following that Rak'ah. Then he said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I am the one among you whose prayer most closely resembles that of the Messenger of Allah (ï·º). And this is how he continued to pray until he left this world",
