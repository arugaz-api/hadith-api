Dhul-Shimalain caught up with him and said: \"O Messenger of Alah, has the prayer been shortened or did you forget?\" He said: \"The prayer has not been shortened, and I did not forget.\" He said: \"Yes, by the One Who sent you with the truth.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Is Dhul-Yadain speaking the truth?\" They said: 'Yes.' So he led the people in praying two rak'ahs",
