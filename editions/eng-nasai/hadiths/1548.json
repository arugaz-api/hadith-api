The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the takbir and we all said the takbir. Then he bowed and we all bowed. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) and the row that was closest to him prostrated, while the others remained standing, guarding us. When we stood up, the others prostrated where we were, then they moved forward and he bowed and they all bowed, then he stood up and they all stood up. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) and the row that was closest to him prostrated, and the others remained standing, guarding them. When they had prostrated and were sitting, the others prostrated where they were, then he said the salam.\" Jabir said: \"As your leaders do",
