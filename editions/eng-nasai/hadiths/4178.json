Whoever fulfills (this pledge), his reward will be with Allah, and whoever commits any of these actions and is punished for it, it will be purification for him. Whoever (commits any of these action then) Allah conceals him, it is up to Allah; if He wills He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him",
