    "text": "It was narrated that 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Abd Rabb Al-Kabah said:\" I came to 'Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-As while he was sitting in the shade of Kabah, and the people were gathered around him, and I heard him say: 'While we were with the Messenger of Allah on a journey, we stopped to camp, and some of us were pitching tents, some were competing in shooting arrows, and some were taking the animals out to race them. Then the caller of the Prophet called out: As-Salatu Jamiah (prayer is about to begin). So we gathered, and the Messenger of Allah stood up and addressed us. He said: There has a never been a prophet before me who was not obliged to tell his nation of what he knew was good for them, and to warn against that he knew was bad for them. With regard to Ummah of yours, soundness (of religious commitment) has been placed in its earlier generations, and the last of them will be afflicted with calamities and things that you dislike. Then there will come tribulations which will make the earlier ones pale into significances, and the believer will say: This will be then end of me, then relief will come. Then (more) tribulations will come and the believer will say: this will be the end of me, then relief will come. Whoever would like to be taken far away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, let him die believing in Allah and the Last Day, and let him treat people as he would like to be treated. Whoever pledges to a ruler and gives him the grasp of his hand and the sincerity of his heart, the let him obey him as much as he can, and if another comes and challenges him, let them strike the neck of (i.e., kill) the second one.\"' He said: \" I drew near to him and said: 'Did you hear the Messenger of Allah say that? He 'Yes, and quoted the Hadith without interruption (in the chain)",
