Dhul-Yadain stood up and said: 'Has the prayer been shortened, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or did you forget?' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Neither.' He said: 'One of them happened, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned to the people and said: 'Is Dhul-Yadain speaking the truth?' They said: 'Yes.'
