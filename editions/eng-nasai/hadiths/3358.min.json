Go to someone else.' They kept coming to him for a month, then at the end of that they said: 'Who shall we ask if we do not ask you? You are one of the most prominent Companions of Muhammad in this land and we cannot find anyone else.' He said: 'I will say what I think, and if it is correct then it is from Allah alone, with no partner, and if it is wrong then it is from me and from the Shaitan, and Allah and His Messenger have nothing to do with it. I think she should be given a dowry like that of her peers and no less, with no injustice, and she may inherit from him, and she has to observe the 'Iddah, four months and ten days.'\" He said: \"And that was heard by some people from Ashja', who stood up and said: 'We bear witness that you have passed the same judgment as the Messenger of Allah did concerning a woman from among us who was called Birwa' bint Washiq.'\" He said: \"Abdullah was never seen looking so happy as he did on that day, except with having accepted Islam","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":163}}}
