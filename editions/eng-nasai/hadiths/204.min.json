When you period goes, perform Ghusl and pray, and when it comes, stop praying (for that period).'\" 'Aishah said: \"She used to perform Ghusl for every prayer and pray. Sometimes she would perform Ghusl in a washtub in the room of her sister Zainab when she was with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the water would turn red with blood, then she would go out and pray with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). That did not stop her from praying","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":205}}}
