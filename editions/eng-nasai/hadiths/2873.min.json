In front of the Messenger of Allah and in the Sancturary of Allah, the Might and Sublime, you recite poetry?\" The Prophet said: \"Let him do so, for what he is saying is more effective than shooting arrows at them","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":256}}}
