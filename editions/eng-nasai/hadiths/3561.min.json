The people have lost interest in horses and put down their weapons, and they say there is no Jihad, and that war has ended.' The Messenger of Allah turned to face him and said: 'They are lying, now the fighting is to come. There will always be a group among my Ummah who will fight for the truth, for whom Allah will cause some people to deviate, and grant them provision from them, until the Hour begins and until the promise of Allah comes. Goodness is tied to the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection. It has been revealed to me that I am going to die and will not stay long, and you will follow me group after group, striking one another's necks. And the place of safety for the believers is Ash-Sham","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":1}}}
