While we were in our camping place unloading our mounts, someone came to us and said: 'The people have gathered in the Masjid and there is panis.' So we set out and found the people gathered around a group in the middle of the Masjid, among whom were 'Ali, Zubayr, Talhah and Sa'd bin Abi Waqas. While we were like that, 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, came, wearing a yellow cloak with which he had covered his head. He said: 'Is Talhah here? Is Az-Zubair here? Is Sa'd here?' They said: 'Yes.' He said: 'I adjure you be the One beside Whom there is none worthy of worship, din't the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Whoever buys the Mirbad [1] of Banu so-and so, Allah will forgive him, and I bought it for twenty or twenty-five thousand, then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him, and he said: Add it to our Masjid and the reward for it will be yours?' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by the One beside Whom there is none worthy of worship, didn't the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Whoever buys the well of Rumah, Allah will forgive him, so I bought it for such and such and amount, then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him, and he said: Give it to provide water for the Muslims, and the reward for it will be yours?' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by the One beside Whom there is none worthy of worship, didn't the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Whoever equips these (men)- meaning the army of Al-'Usrah (Tabuk) - Allah will forgive him, so I equipped them until they were not lacking even a rope or a bridle?' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'O Allah, bear witness, O Allah, bear witness, O Allah, bear witness.'\" [1] Mirbad: A place for drying dates","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":98}}}
