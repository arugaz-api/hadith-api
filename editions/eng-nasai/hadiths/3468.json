    "text": "It was narrated that Muhammad said:\"I asked Anas bin Malik about that, as I thought that he had knowledge of that. He said: 'Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife (of committing adultery) with Sharik bin As-Sahma', who was the brother of Al-Bara' bin Malik through his mother. He was the first one who engaged in the procedure of Li'an. The Messenger of Allah conducted the procedure of Li'an between them, then he said: \"Look and see, if she produces a child who is white, with straight hair and Qadiy'a eyes, then he belongs to Hilal bin Umayyah, and if she produces a child who has dark lines around his eyes, curly hair and narrow calves, then he belongs to Sharik bin As-Sahma'.\" I was told that she produced a child who has dark lines around his eyes, curly hair and narrow calves",
