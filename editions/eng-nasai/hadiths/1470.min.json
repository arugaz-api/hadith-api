He led the people in prayer and stood for a very long time, then he bowed, then he stood, then he bowed, then he stood, then he bowed. He prayed two rak'ahs, bowing three times in each rak'ah. After bowing for the third time he prostrated for a long time. Some men fainted on that day and had to be revived by having buckets of water thrown over them, because of having stood for so log. When he bowed, he said: Allahu Akbar, and when he raised his head, he said: Sami' Allahu lima hamidah.He did not finish until the eclipse had ended. Then he stood and praised and glorified Allah (SWT) and said: The sun and moon do not eclipse for the death or birth of anyone, but they are two of the signs of Allah (SWT) with which He strikes fear unto you. If they are eclipsed then turn to the remembrance of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, until it (the eclipse) is over","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Shadh"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Shadh"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":12}}}
