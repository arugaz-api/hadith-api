Then they found one of their numbers slain. They said to those in whose land they found him: 'You killed our companion!' They said: 'We did not kill him and we do not know who killed him.' They went to the prophet of Allah and said: 'O Prophet of Allah, we went to Khaibar and we found one of our number slain.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'Let the elders speak first.' And he said to them: 'Bring proof of the one whom you suspect killed him.' They said: 'We do not have any proof.' He said: \"Then let them swear an oath to you.' They said\" 'We will not accept the oath of the Jews.' The Messenger of Allah did not want his blood to have been shed with no Justice done, so he paid a Diyah of one hundred camels from the Sadaqah.\" 'Amr bin Shu'aib differed with them","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":14}}}
