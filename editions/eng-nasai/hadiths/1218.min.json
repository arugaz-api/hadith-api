Some men among us follow omens.' He said: 'That is something that they find in their own hearts; it should not deter them from going ahead.' I said: 'And some men among us go to fortune tellers.' He said: 'Do not go to them.' He said: 'Some men among us draw lines.' He said: 'One of the Prophets used to draw lines. So whoever is in accord with his drawing of lines, then so it is.'\" He said: \"While I was praying with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a man sneezed and I said: 'Yarhamuk-Allah (May Allah have mercy on you).' The people glared at me and I said: 'May my mother be bereft of me, why are you looking at me?' The people struck their hands against their thighs, and when I saw that they were telling me to be quiet, I fell silent. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished, he called me. May my father and mother be ransomed for him, he neither did hit me nor rebuke me nor revile me. I have never seen a better teacher than him, before or after. He said: 'This prayer of ours is not the place for ordinary human speech, rather it is glorification and magnification of Allah (SWT), and reciting Qur'an.' Then I went out to a flock of sheep of mine that was tended by a slave woman of mine beside Uhud and Al-Jawwaniyyah, and I found that the wolf had taken one of the sheep. I am a man from the sons of Adam and I get upset as they get upset. So I slapped her. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him what happened. He regarded that as a serious action on my part. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), should I set her free?' He said: 'Call her.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to her: 'Where is Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime?' She said: 'Above the heavens.' He said: 'And who am I?' She said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' He said: 'She is a believer, set her free","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":40}}}
