    "text": "Al-Husain bin 'Ali said:\"My father 'Ali called me to bring (water for) Wudu', so I brought it to him, and he started by washing his hands three times, before putting them into the water. Then he rinsed his mouth three times and sniffed water into his nose and blew it out three times. Then he washed his face three times, then his right hand up to the elbow three times, then his left likewise. Then he wiped his head once then he washed his right foot up to the ankle three times, then the left likewise. Then he stood up and said: 'Pass me the vessel.' So I passed the vessel containing the remaining water for his Wudu' to him, and he drank from it standing up. I was surprised and when he noticed that he said: 'Do not be surprised, for I saw your father the Prophet (ï·º) doing,' referring to his Wudu' and drinking the leftover water while standing",
