We said: 'Even if we cannot do it, we still want to hear about it.' He said: 'When the sun reached the same height (in the east) as it reaches (in the west) at the time of 'Asr, he would pray two rak'ahs, and when the sun reached the same height (in the east) as it reaches (in the west) at the time for Zuhr he would pray four Rak'ahs. He would pray four Rak'ahs before Zuhr and two after, and he would pray four Rak'ahs before 'Asr, separating each two Rak'ahs with Taslim upon the angels who are close to Allah, and the prophets, and those who follow them of the believers and Muslims",
