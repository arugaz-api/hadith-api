    "text": "It was narrated from Jabir that:when the Prophet came back from the Umrah of Al-Jirranah, he sent Abu Bakr to lead the Hajj. We wnet the him until, when he was in Al-Urj, the Iqamah for Subh was said, and he stood up to say the Takbir while he heard the grunting of a camel behind him, and he did not say the Takbir. He said: \"This is the grunting of the camel of the Messenger of Allah has had second thoughts about the Hajj, and may be he is here, and we will pray with him.\" But it was 'Ali on the camel. Abu Bakr said to him: \"(Have you come) as a leader or as messenger?\" He said: \"No, as a messenger, sent by the Messenger of Allah with a declaration of innocence to recite it to the people in the stations of Hajj. So we came to makkah and one day before the day of At-Tarwiyah Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and addressed the people telling them about their rituals. When he finished, Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and recited the declaration of innocence to the people until he finished it. Then we went out with hm and on the day of Arafat. Abu Bakr stood up and addressed people, telling them about rituals. When he finished, Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and recited the declaration of innocence to the people until he finished it. Then on the day of Sacrifice, we departed (Ifadah) and when Abu Bakr came back, eh addressed the people, telling them about their departure (Ifadah), sacrifice and rituals. When he finished, Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and recited the declaration of innocence to the people until he finished it. On the first day of An-Nafr (The 12th of Dhul-Hijjah), Abu Bakr stood up and addressed the people, telling them how to offer their sacrifice and how to stone the Jamrat, and teaching them their rituals. When he had finished, \"Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and recited the declaration of innocence to the people until he finished it. (Daif) Abu Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasai) said: Ibn Khuthaim is not strong in Hadith, and I only narrated this so it would not be considered to be from Ibn Juraij from Abu Az-Zubai. And we did not write it except from Ishaq bin Rahuyah bin Ibrahm. And yahya bin Saeed Al-Qattan did not abandon the narrations of Ibn Khuthaim, or dod Abdur-Rahamn. However, Ali bin Al-Madini said: \"Ibn Khuthaim is Munkar in Hadith,\" and Ali bin Al-Madini is more knowledgeable of Hadith",
