    "text": "It was narrated from Al-Ja'd bin Abi 'Uthman, that Anas bin Malik said:\"The Messenger of Allah got married and consummated the marriage with his wife.\" He said: \"My mother Umm Sulaim made some Hais, and I brought it to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'My mother sends you greetings of Salam, and says to you: 'This is a little from us.'' He said: 'Put it down.' Then he said: 'Go and call so-and-so, and so-and-so, and whoever you meet,' and he named some men. So I called those whom he named and those whom I met.\" I said to Anas: \"How many were they?\" He said: \"About three hundred. Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'Let them sit around the dish of food in groups of ten, one after the other, and let each person eat from what is closest to him.' They ate until they were full, then one group went out and another group came in. He said to me: 'O Anas, clear it away.' So I cleared it away, and I do not know whether there was more when I cleared it away, or when I put it down",
