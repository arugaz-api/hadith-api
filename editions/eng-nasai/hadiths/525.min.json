I forgot what he said about Maghrib. 'And he used to like to delay 'Isha', which you call Al-'Atamah, and he did not like to sleep before it nor talk after it. And he used to finish the Al-Ghadah (Fajr) prayer when a man could recognize his neighbor, and he used to recite (in it) between sixty and one hundred verses","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":32}}}
