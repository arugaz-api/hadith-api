    "text": "It was narrated that Anas said:\"The Messenger of Allah set out and we set out with him. When he reached Dhul-Hulaifah he prayed Zuhr, then he rode his mount, and when it stood up with him at Al-Baida, he initiated Ihram for Hajj and Umrah together, and we initiated Ihram with him. When the Messenger of Allah came to Makkah and we had performed Tawaf, he told the people to exit Ihram but they hesitated. The Messenger of Allah said to them: 'Were it not for the fact that I have the Hadi with me, I would have exited Ihra.' So the people exited Ihram completely, such that intimacy with their wives became permissible. But the Messenger of Allahd did not exit Ihram, and he did not cut his hair until the Day of Sacrifice",
