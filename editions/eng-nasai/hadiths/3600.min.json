He came to the Prophet and consulted him about it. He said: 'I have acquired a great deal of land, and I have never acquired any wealth that is more precious to me than it. What do you command me to do with it?' He said: 'If you wish, you may freeze it and give it in charity.' So he gave it in charity on condition that it would not be sold or given away, and he gave it in charity to the poor, relatives, to emancipate slaves, for the cause of Allah, for wayfarers and guests. There is no sin -on the administrator- if he eats (from it) or feeds a friend, with no intention of becoming wealthy from it.'\" These are the wordings of Isma'il","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":7}}}
