His deputy sent some barley to her but she did not like it. He said:\"By Allah, you have no rights over us.\" She went to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that, and he said: \"You have no right to maintenance.\" He told her to observe her 'Iddah in the house of Umm Sharik, then he said: \"She is a woman whose house is frequented by my Companions. Observe your 'Iddah in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man and you can take off your garment. And when your 'Iddah is over, let me know.\" She said: \"When my 'Iddah was over I told him that Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm had proposed marriage to me. The Messenger of Allah said: 'As for Abu Jahm, his stick never leaves his shoulder, and as for Mu'awiyah he is a poor man who has no wealth. Rather you should marry Usamah bin Zaid.' I did not like the idea, then he said: 'Marry Usamah bin Zaid.' So I married him and Allah created a lot of good in him, and others felt jealous of my good fortune","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":50}}}
