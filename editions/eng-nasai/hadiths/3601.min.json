He came to the Prophet and consulted him about that. He said:\"If you wish, you may 'freeze' it and give it in charity.\" So he 'froze' it, stipulating that it should not be sold, given as a gift or inherited, and he gave it in charity to the poor, relatives, slaves, the needy, wayfarers and guests.
