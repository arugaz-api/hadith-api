If the Messenger of Allah told you anything, then tell us,\" He said: \"The Messenger of Allah did not tell me anything that he did not tell the people, except that in the sheath of my sword there is a sheet, in which it says: 'The lives of the believers are equal in value, and they hasten to support the asylum granted by the least of them.
