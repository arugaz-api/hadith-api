Hafsah and I agreed that if the Prophet came to either of us, she would say: 'I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty-smelling gum) on you. Have you eaten Maghafir?' He went to one of them and she said that to him. He said: 'No, rather I drank honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I will never do it again.' Then the following was revealed: 'O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you' up to: 'If you two turn in repentance to Allah' -'Aishah and Hafsah- 'And (remember) when the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives.' refers to him saying: 'No, rather I drank honey",
