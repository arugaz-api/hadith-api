I had too much respect for the Messenger of Allah [SAW] to ride the mount of the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. Then he said: 'Why don't you ride, O 'Uqbah?' I was worried that I might be disobeying him, so he got off, and I rode for a little while, then I got off and the Messenger of Allah [SAW] rode. Then he said: 'Shall I not teach you two of the best Surahs that the people recite?' And he taught me: 'Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of the daybreak,' and 'Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of mankind.\" Then the Iqamah was said and he went forward and recited them. Then he passed by me and said: 'What do you think, O 'Uqbah bin 'Amir? Recite them every time you go to sleep and get up","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":50,"hadith":10}}}
