He stayed late one night and prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) then he went back to his people to lead them in prayer, and he recited Surat Al-Baqarah. When a man from his people heard that, he stepped aside and prayed (on his own), then he left. They said: 'You have become a hypocrite, 0 so and-so!' He said: 'By Allah, I have not become a hypocrite, and I will go to the Prophet (ﷺ) and tell him (about that),' So he went to the Prophet and said: '0 Messenger of Allah(ﷺ), Muadh prays with you, then he comes to lead us in prayer. You delayed the prayer, and he prayed with you then he came back to lead us in prayer, and he started to recite Shut Al-Baqarah. When I heard that, I stepped aside and prayed by myself, because we are people who bring water with the camels and we work hard.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: '0 Muadh, do you want to cause hardship to the people? Recite such and such a Surah, and such and such a Surah","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":59}}}
