Two angels come to him, making him sit up, and say to him: 'What did you say about this man (Muhammad)?' As for the believer, he says: 'I bear witness that he says: 'I bear witness that he is the slave of Allah and His Messenger.' It is said to him: 'Look at your place in hell; Allah has replaced it for you with a place better than it.''' The Messenger of Allah said: \"Then he sees them both.\" As for the disbeliever or the hypocrite, it is said to him: 'What did you say about this man?' He says: 'I do not know; I used to say what the people said.' It is said to him: 'You did not understand and you did not follow those who had understanding.' Then he is dealt a blow between his ears and the man utters a scream which everything near him hears, except for the two races","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":234}}}
