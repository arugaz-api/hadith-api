A man stood up and said: 'Marry me to her.' He said: 'Go and find (something), even if it is an iron ring.' So he went, but he could not find anything, not even an iron ring. So the Messenger of Allah said: 'Do you have (memorized) any surahs of the Qur'an?' He said: 'Yes.' So he married him to her on the basis of what he knew of surahs of the Qur'an",
