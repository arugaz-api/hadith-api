    "text": "It was narrated from \"Imran bin Husain that:a woman from Juhainah came to the Messenger of Allah sand said: \"I have committed Zina.\" And she was committed Zina.\" And She was pregnant. He handed her over to her guardian and said: \"Look after her, and when she gave birth, he brought her to him. He ordered that her garment be wrapped around her, then he offered the funeral prayer for her. 'Umar said to him: \"Are you praying for her even though she committed Zina?\" he said: \"She has repented in a manner that, if it were to be shared among seventy of the people of Al-Madinah it would suffice them. Have you ever seen repentance better than the one who sacrificed herself for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime?",
