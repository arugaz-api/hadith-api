    "text": "Mu'adh bin Jabal said that he heard the Prophet (ï·º) say:\"Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, for the length of time between two milkings of a she-camel, Paradise is guaranteed for him. Whoever asks Allah to be killed (in Jihad) sincerely, from his heart, then he dies or is killed, he will have the reward of a martyr. Whoever is wounded or injured in the cause of Allah, it will come on the Day of Resurrection bleeding the most it ever bled, but its color will be like saffron, and its fragrance will be like musk. Whoever is wounded in the cause of Allah, upon him is the seal of the martyrs",
