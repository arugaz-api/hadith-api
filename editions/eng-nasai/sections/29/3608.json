Yet today you are preventing me from drinking from it, so that I have to drink salty water.' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah and by Islam, are you aware that I equipped the army of Al-'Usrah (Tabuk) from my own wealth?' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah and by Islam, are you aware that when the Masjid became too small for the people and the Messenger of Allah said: Who will buy the plot of the family of so and so and add it to the Masjid, in return for a better plot in Paradise? I bought it with my capital and added it to the Masjid? Yet now you are preventing me from praying two Rak'ahs therein.' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah and by Islam, are you aware that when the Messenger of Allah was atop Thabir -the Thabir in Makkah- and with him were Abu Bakr, 'Umar and myself, the mountain shook, and the Messenger of Allah kicked it with his foot and said: Be still, Thabir, for upon you are a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs?' They said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said: 'Allahu Akbar! They have testified for me, by the Lord of the Ka'bah' -i.e., that I am a martyr",
