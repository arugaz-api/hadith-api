The matter was referred to the prophet and he set the blood money for her child at five hundred sheep. And on that day, he forbade throwing pebbles. (Sahih) Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'i) said: This is an error, and it must be that the intent was one hundred camels. And the prohibition of throwing pebbles has been related from 'Abdullah bin Buraidah, from 'Abdullah bin Mughaffal",
