She said: 'He used to sleep during the first part of the night, then get up during the time before dawn and pray witr. Then he would go to his bed and if he needed to be intimate he would go to his wife. Then when he heard the Adhan he would get up, and if he was junub he would pour water over himself, otherwise he would perform wudu, then he would go out to the prayer",
