People who travel all night until sleep becomes dearer to them than anything equated with it, so they lay down their heads (and slept), then a man among them got up and started praying to Me and beseeching Me, reciting My Verses. And a man who was on a campaign and met the enemy and they fled, but he went forward (pursuing them) until he was killed or victory was granted","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":18}}}
