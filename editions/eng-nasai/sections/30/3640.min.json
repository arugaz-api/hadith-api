I offered to his creditors that they could take the fruits in lieu of what he owed them, but they refused as they thought that it would not cover the debt. I went to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that, he said: 'When you pick the dates and have put them in the Mirbad (place for drying dates), call me.'

I mentioned that to him and he smiled and said: 'Go to Abu Bakr and 'Umar and tell them about that.' So I went to Abu Bakr and 'Umar and told them about that, and they said: 'We knew, when the Messenger of Allah did what he did, that this would happen","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":30,"hadith":30}}}
