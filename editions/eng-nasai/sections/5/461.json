    "text": "It was narrated from Ibn Muhairiz that a man from Banu Kinanah who was called Al-Mukhdaji heard a man in Ash-Sham, who was known as Abu Muhammad, saying that Witr was obligatory. Al-Mukhdaji said:\"In the morning I went to 'Ubadah bin As-Samit, and I met him while he was on his way to the Masjid. I told him what Abu Muhammad said, and 'Ubadah said: 'Abu Muhammad is wrong. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) say: 'Five prayers are those that Allah has decreed for (His) slaves, whoever does them, and does not neglect any of them out of disregard toward them, will have a promise from Allah that He will admit him to Paradise. And whoever does not to them will have no such promise from Allah; if He wills he will punish him and if He wills He will admit him to Paradise",
