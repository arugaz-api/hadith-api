If it is sound then he will have succeeded, be salvaged, but if it is not then he will have lost and be doomed.\" - (One of the narrators) Hammam said: \"I do not know whether this was the words of Qatadah or part of the report.\" - \"If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, He will say: 'Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary prayers to make up for what is deficient from his obligatory prayers.'
