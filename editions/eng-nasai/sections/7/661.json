    "text": "It was narrated from 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Sa'eed that his father said:\"On the day of Al-Khandaq the idolators kept us from praying Zuhr until the sun had gone down; that was before the revelation concerning fighting was revealed. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting.[1] The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) commanded Bilal to say the Iqamah for Zuhr prayer, and he offered it just as he used to offer it on time. Then he said the Iqamah for 'Asr and he offered it just as he used to offer it on time. Then he called the Adhan for Maghrib and offered it on time.\" [1] Al-Ahzab 33:",
