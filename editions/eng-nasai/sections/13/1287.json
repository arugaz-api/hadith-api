He said: \"Say: 'Alahumma salli 'ala Muhammad wa 'ala ali Muhammad, kama sallaita 'ala Ibrahima wa barik 'ala Muhammad kama barakta 'ala ali Ibrahim fil-'alamin, innaka hamidun majid (O Allah, send salah upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent salah upon the family of Ibrahim, and send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibrahim among the nations. You are indeed Worthy of praise, Full of glory.)'\" (One of the narrators) Ibn Abi Laila said: \"We used to say: 'And also upon us.'\" Abu Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasa'I) said: It was narrated from his book, and this is a mistake",
