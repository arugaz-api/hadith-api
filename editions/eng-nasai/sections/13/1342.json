Allahumma la mani' lima a'taita wa la mu'tia lima mana'ta wa la yanfa'u dhal-jaddi minka al-jadd. (There is none worthy of worship except Allah (ﷺ) alone with no partner or associate. He is the Dominion and to Him be all praise, and He is able to do all things. O Allah, one can withhold what You have given and none can give what You have withheld, and no wealth or fortune can benefit anyone for from You comes all wealth and fortune",
