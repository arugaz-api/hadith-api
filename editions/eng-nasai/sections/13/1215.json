    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Ad-Darda' said:\"The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) stood praying, and we heard him say: 'I seek refuge with Allah from you.' Then he said: 'I curse you with the curse of Allah (SWT),' three times and stretched out his hand as if to take something. When he finished praying we said: 'O Messenger of Allah, we heard you say something in your prayer that we have never heard you say before, and we saw you stretch out your hand.' He said: 'The enemy of Allah (SWT), Iblis, came with a brand of fire to throw it in my face, so I said: I seek refuge with Allah from you three times, then I wanted to take hold of him. By Allah (SWT), were it not for the prayer of our brother Sulaiman, he would have been tied up this morning for the children of Al-Madinah to play with him",
