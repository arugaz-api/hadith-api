    "text": "It was narrated that Ka'b bin 'Ujrah said:'We said: \"O Messenger of Allah (ï·º), we know about sending salams upon you, but how should we send salah upon you?\" He said: 'Say: Alahumma salli 'ala Muhammad wa 'ala ali Muhammad, kama sallaita 'ala Ibrahima wa barik 'ala Muhammad kama barakta 'ala ali Ibrahim fil-'alamin, innaka hamidun majid (O Allah, send salah upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent salah upon the family of Ibrahim, and send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibrahim among the nations. You are indeed Worthy of praise, Full of glory.)'\" (One of the narrators) 'abdur Rahman said: \"We used to say: 'And also upon us.'\" Abu Abdur-rahman (An Nasa'i) said: This is more worthy of being correct than the one that is before it. And we do not know of anyone who said \"Amr bin Murrah\" in it other than in this case. And Allah (SWT) knows best",
