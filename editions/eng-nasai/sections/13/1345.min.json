I said: 'You are lying.' She said: 'No, it is true; we cut our skin and clothes because of it.' The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) went out to pray and our voices became loud. He said: 'What is this?' So I told him what she had said. He said: 'She spoke the truth.' After that day he never offered any prayer but he said, following the prayer: 'Rabba Jibril wa Mika'il wa Israfil, aiding min harrin-nar wa 'adhabil-qabr (Lord of Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil, grant me refuge from the heat of the Fire and the torment of the grave)","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":167}}}
