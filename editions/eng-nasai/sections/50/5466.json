    "text": "It was narrated that 'Aishah said:\"The Messenger of Allah [SAW] often used to say these words in his supplication: 'Allahumma, inni a'udhu bika min fitnatin-nari, wa 'adhabin-nari, wa fitnatil-qabri, wa 'adhabil-qabr, wa sharri fitnatil masihid-dajjal, wa sharri fitnatil-faqri, wa sharri fitnatil-ghina. Allahummaghsil khatayaya bima'ith-thalji wal-baradi wa anqi qalbi minal-khataya kama anqaitath-thawbal-abyada min ad-danasi, wa ba'id baini wa baina khatayaya kama ba'adta bainal-mashriqi wal-maghrib. Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-kasali wal harami, wal ma'thami wal-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the tribulation of the Fire and the torment of the Fire, from the tribulation of the grave and the torment of the grave, from the evil of the tribulation of the Al-Masihid-Dajjal, from the evil of the tribulation of poverty and from the evil of the tribulation of richness. O Allah, wash away my sins with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from all the sins as you would cleanse white garment from the filth, and put a great distance between me and my sins, as great as the distance You have made between the East and the West. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from laziness, old age, sin and debt)",
