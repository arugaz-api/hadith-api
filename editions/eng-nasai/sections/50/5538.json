Allahumma at nafsi taqwaha, wa zakkaha anta khairu min zakkaha, anta waliyyuha wa mawlaha. Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min nafsin la tashba'u wa min qalbin la yakhsha'u wa min 'ilmin la yanfa'u wa du'a'in la yustajab (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from incapacity, laziness, miserliness, cowardice, old age, the torment of the grave. O Allah, make my soul obedient and purify it, for You are the best One to purify it, You are its Guardian and Lord. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a soul that is not satisfied, a heart that is not humble, knowledge that is of no benefit and a supplication that is not answered)",
