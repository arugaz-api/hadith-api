He said: 'Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-'ajzi wal-kasali, wal-bukhli, wal-jubni, wal-harami, wa 'adhabil-qabri, Allahumma ati nafsi taqwaha, wa zakkiha anta khairu min zakkaha, anta waliyyuha wa mawlaha. Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min qalbin la yakhsha'u wa min nafsin la tashba'u wa 'ilmin la yanfa'u wa da'watin la yustajabu laha (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from incapacity, laziness, miserliness, cowardice, old age, the torment of the grave. O Allah, make my soul obedient and purify it, for You are the best One to purify it, You are its Guardian and Lord. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a heart that is not humble, a soul that is not satisfied, knowledge that is of no benefit and a supplication that is not answered)",
