He said: 'If you strike (the game) with its sharp point, then eat, but if you strike it with its broad side, then the animal has been killed with a blow.' I asked him about dogs and he said: 'If you release your dog and he catches (the game) but does not eat it, then eat, because his catching it is its slaughter. If you find another dog with your dog and you fear that it caught (the game) with him and killed it, then do not eat, for you said the name of Allah over your dog, but you did not say His name over the other one","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":2}}}
