    "text": "It was narrated that 'Amr said:\"I heard Jabir say: 'The Messenger of Allah sent us, three hundred riders led by Abu 'Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, to lie in wait for the caravan of the Quraish. We stayed on the coast and became very hungry, so much so that we ate Khabat. Then the sea cast ashore a beast called (Al-'Anbar), and we ate from it for half a month, and daubed our bodies with its fat, and our health was restored. Abu 'Ubaidah took one it its ribs and looked for the tallest camel and the tallest man in the army, and he passed beneath it. Then they got hungry again and a man slaughtered three camels, then they got hungry and a man slaughtered three camels, then they got hungry and a man slaughtered three camels, then they got hungry and a man slaughtered three camels. Then Abu 'Ubaidah told him not to do that.\" (One of the narrators) Sufyan said: \"Abu Az-Zubair said, narrating from Jabir: \"We asked the Prophet and he said: 'Do you have anything left of it?\"' he said; \"We took out, such-and -such an amount of a fat from its (the whale's) eyes, and four men could fit into its eye socket. Abu 'Ubaidah had a sack of dates and he used to give them out by the handful, then he started to give one date at a time, and when we ran out of dates it became very difficult for us",
