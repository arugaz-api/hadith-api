The people found out about that and they prayed when he prayed, with the mat in between him and them. He said: 'Do as much of good deeds as you can, for Allah does not get tired (of giving reward) until you get tired. And the most beloved of deeds to Allah are those that are continuous, even if they are few.' Then he stopped that prayer and did not return to it until Allah took him (in death), and if he started to do something he would persist in it","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":21}}}
