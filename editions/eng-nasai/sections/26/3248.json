    "text": "It was narrated that 'Umar said:\"Hafsah bint 'Umar became single when (her husband) Khunais -meaning bin Hudhafah- (died). He was one of the Companions of the Prophet who had been present at Badr, and he died in Al-Madinah. I met 'Uthman bin 'Affan and offered Hafsah in marriage to him. I said: 'If you wish, I will marry you to Hafsah.' He said: 'I will think about it.' A few days passed, then I met him and he said: 'I do not want to get married at the moment.'\" 'Umar said: \"Then I met Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'If you wish, I will marry Hafsah to you.' He did not give me any answer, and I felt more upset with him than I had with 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him. Several days passed, then the Messenger of Allah proposed marriage to her, and I married her to him. Abu Bakr met me and said: 'Perhaps you felt upset with me when you offered Hafsah in marriage to me and I did not give you an answer?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Nothing prevented me from giving you an answer when you made the offer to me except the fact that I had heard the Messenger of Allah speak of her, and I did not want to disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah; if he had left her, then I would have married her",
