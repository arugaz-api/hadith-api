He remained silent and the Prophet did not give any answer. Then she stood up (again) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, she has offered herself in marriage to you, so see what you think of her.' A man stood up and said: 'Marry her to me, O Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'Do you have anything?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Go and look, even if it is just an iron ring.' So he went and looked then he came and said: 'I could not find anything, not even an iron ring.' He said: 'Have you memorized anything of the Qur'an?' He said: 'Yes, Surah such-and-such and Surah such-and-such.' He said: 'I will marry you to her on the basis of what you have memorized of the Qur'an","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":85}}}
