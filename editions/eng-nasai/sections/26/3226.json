He said: 'A virgin or a previously-married woman?' I said: 'A previously-married woman.' He said: 'Why not a virgin who would play with you?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I have sisters, and I did not want her to come between them and I.' He said: 'That's better then. A woman may be married for her religious commitment, her wealth or her beauty. You should choose the one who is religiously committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (may you prosper)",
