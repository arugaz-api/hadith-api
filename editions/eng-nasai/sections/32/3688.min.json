We are one of the 'Arab tribes and a calamity has befallen us of which you are well aware. Do us a favor, may Allah bless you.' He said: 'Choose between your wealth or your women and children.' They said: 'You have given us a choice between our families and our wealth; we choose our women and children.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'As for that which was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, it is yours. When I have prayed Zuhr, stand up and say: \"We seek the help of the Messenger of Allah in dealing with the believers, or the Muslims, with regard to our women and children.\"' So when they prayed Zuhr, they stood up and said that. The Messenger of Allah said: 'As for that which was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, it is yours.' The Muhajirun said: 'That which was allocated to us is for the Messenger of Allah.' The Ansar said: 'That which was allocated to us is for the Messenger of Allah.' Al-Aqra' bin Habis said: 'As for myself and Banu Tamim, then no (we will not give it up).' 'Uyaynah bin Hisn said: 'As for myself and Banu Fazarah, then no (we will not give it up).' Al-'Abbas bin Mirdas said: 'As for myself and Banu Sulaim, then no (we will not give it up).' Banu Sulaim stood up and said: 'You lied; whatever was allocated to us, it is for the Messenger of Allah.' The Messenger of Allah said: 'O people, give their women and children back to them. Whoever gives back anything of these spoils of war, he will have six camels from the spoils of war that Allah grants us next.' Then he mounted his riding-animal and the people surrounded him, saying: 'Distribute our spoils of war among us.' They made him go back toward a tree on which his Rida' (upper-wrap) got caught. He said: 'O people! Give me back my Rida'. By Allah! If there were cattle as many in number as the trees of Tihamah I would distribute them among you, then you would not find me a miser, a coward or a liar.' Then he went to a camel and took a hair from its hump between two of his fingers and said: 'Look! I do not have any of the spoils of war. All I have is the Khums, and the Khums will be given back to you.' A man stood up holding a ball of yarn made from goat hair and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I took this to fix my camel-saddle.' He said: 'What was allocated to myself and to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib is for you.' He said: 'Is this so important? I don't need it!' And he threw it down. He said: 'O people! Give back even needles large and small, for Al-Ghulul will be (a source of) shame and disgrace for those who took it on the Day of Resurrection","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":1}}}
