He said: 'Cut off (his hand).' So his hand was cut off. Then he was brought a second time and he said: 'Kill him.' They said; 'O Messenger of Allah, he only stole.' He said: 'Cut off (his foot).' So his foot was cut off. He was brought to him a third time and he said: 'Kill him.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, he only stole. He said: 'Cut off (his other hand).' Then he was brought to him a fourth time and he said: Kill him.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, he only stole.' He said: 'Cut off (his other foot).' He was brought to him a fifth time and he said: \"So we took him to an animal pen and attacked him. He lay down on his back then waved his arms and legs (in the air), and the camels ran away. Then they attacked him a second time and he did the same thing, then they attacked him a third time, and we threw stones at him and killed him, then we threw him into a well and threw stones on top of him.\" (Hasan) Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (An-Nasai) said: This Hadith is Munkar, Musab bin Thabit is not strong in Hadith",
