They said; Who will speak to the Messenger of Allah concerning her?\" They said:\"Who would dare to do that except Usamah bin Zaid, the beloved of the Messenger of Allah?\" so Usamah spoke to him and the Messenger of Allah said: \"Are you interceding concerning one of the Hadd punishments decreed by Allah?\" Then he stood up and addressed (the people) and said: \"Those who came before you were destroyed because, whenever a noble person among them stole, they would let him go. But if a person who was weak stole, they would carry out the punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hnad",
