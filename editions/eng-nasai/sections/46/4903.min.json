Her people went to Uswamah bin Zaid, to ask him to intercede.\" 'Urwah said: \"When Usamah spoke to him concerning her, the face of the Messenger of Allah changed color and he said: 'Are you speaking to me concerning one of the Hadd punishments of Allah?\" Usamah said: 'Pray to Allah for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah.' When evening came, the Messenger of Allah stood up to deliver a speech. He praised Allah as He deserves, then he said: 'The people who came before you were destroyed because, whenever a noble person among them stole, they would carry out the Hadd punishment on him. By the One in whose hand is my soul, if Fatimah bint Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.' Then the Messenger of Allah ordered that the hand of that woman be cut off. After that she repented sincerely, and 'Aishah said: 'She used to come to me after that, and I would convey her needs to the Messenger of Allah","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":46,"hadith":34}}}
