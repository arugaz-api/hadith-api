    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:\"I was sitting with the Prophet [SAW] when a woman came to him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, two bracelets of gold.' He said: 'Two bracelets of fire.' She said: 'O Messenger of Allah, a necklace of gold.' He said: 'A necklace of fire.' She said: 'Two earrings of gold.' He said: 'Two earrings of fire.' She was wearing two bracelets of gold, so she took them off and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, if a woman does not adorn herself for her husband, she will become unattractive to him.' He said: 'What is there to keep any one of you from making earrings of silver and painting them yellow with saffron or some 'Abir'?' This is the wording of Ibn Harb",
