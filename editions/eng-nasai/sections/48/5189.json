The Messenger of Allah [SAW] had a stick in his hand and the Prophet [SAW] struck his finger. The man said: \"What's wrong with me, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said: \"Why don't you get rid of this thing that is on your finger?\" The man took it and threw it away. The Prophet [SAW] saw him after that and said: \"What happened to the ring?\" He said: \"I threw it away.\" He said: \"I did not tell you to do that, rather I told you to sell it and benefit from its price.\" This Hadith is Munkar",
