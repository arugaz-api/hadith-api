It was said to him: 'How soon you took it off, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Jibril, peace be upon him, prohibited me from wearing it.' Then 'Umar came weeping and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, you disliked something but you gave it to me.' He said: 'I did not give it to you to wear it, rather I gave it to you to sell it.' So 'Umar sold it for two thousand Dirhams",
