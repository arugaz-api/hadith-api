He said: 'Take him away.' When he went and turned away from him, he called him back and said: 'Will you forgive him?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you accept the Diyah?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Will you kill him?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Take him away.' When he went and turned away from him, he called him back and said: 'Will you forgive him?'
