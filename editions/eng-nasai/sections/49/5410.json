    "text": "It was narrated from Abu Hurairah and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani that:Two men referred a dispute to the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. One of them said: \"O Messenger of Allah, pass judgment between us according to the Book of Allah.\" The other, who was wiser, said: \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah, and allow me to speak.\" He said: \"My son was a laborer serving this man, and he committed Zina with his wife. They told me that my son was to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with one hundred sheep and a slave girl of mine. Then I asked the people of knowledge, who told me that my son was to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for a year, and that his (the man's) wife was to be stoned to death.\" The Messenger of Allah [SAW] said: \"By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I will pass judgment between you according to the Book of Allah. As for your sheep and your slave girl, take them back.\" Then he gave his son one hundred lashes, and exiled him for one year, and he ordered Unais to go to the wife of the other man and if she confessed, to stone her to death. She did confess, so he stoned her to death",
