He said: \"What is this noise?\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they have a drink that they drink.\" He sent for those people and said: \"In what do you soak (fruit - to make that drink)?\" They said: \"We soak (fruits) in vessels carved from wood and gourds, and we have no water skins (that can be closed).\" He said: \"Do not drink except from a vessel that can be tied closed.\" Then as much time as Allah willed passed, then he went back to them and they had fallen sick and become pallid. He said: \"Why do you look so ill?\" They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, our land is unhealthy and you forbade to us everything except that which was in a vessel that could be tied closed.\" He said: \"Drink, but every intoxicant is unlawful","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":117}}}
