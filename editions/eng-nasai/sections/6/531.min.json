He said: 'I heard Ibn 'Abbas say: \"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) delayed Al-'Atamah one night until the people had slept and woken up, then slept and woken up again. Then 'Umar got up and said: 'The prayer, the prayer!'\" 'Ata' said: 'Ibn 'Abbas said: \"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out, and it is as if I can see him now, with water dripping from his head, putting his hand on the side of his head. [He said: \"And he indicated (how)\"].'\" I checked with 'Ata' how the Prophet (ﷺ) put his hand on his head, and he showed me the same way as Ibn 'Abbas had done. 'Ata' spread his fingers a little, then placed them with the tips of his fingers on his forehead, then he drew his fingers together on his head until his thumb touched the edge of the ear that is next to the face, then moved it to his temple and forehead, then he said: 'Were it not that I would impose too much difficulty for my Ummah, I would have commanded them to offer this prayer only at this time","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":38}}}
