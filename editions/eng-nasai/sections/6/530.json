He said: He used to pray Zuhr, which you call Al-Uala (the first) when the sun passed its zenith; he used to pray 'Asr then one of us could go back to his home in the farthest part of Al-Madinah when the sun was still bright.'\" - He said: \"I forgot what he said to me about Maghrib.\" - \"And he used to like to delay 'Isha', which you call Al-'Atamah, and he did not like to sleep before it nor speak after it. And he used to finish the Al-Ghadah (Fajr) prayer when a man could recognize his neighbor, and he used to recite between sixty and one hundred verses",
