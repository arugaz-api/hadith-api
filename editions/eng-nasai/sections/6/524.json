We said to him: 'Tell us about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' That was at the time of Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf. He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out and prayed Zuhr when the sun had passed its zenith and the shadow (of a thing) was the length of a sandal-strap. Then he prayed 'Asr when the shadow of a man was the length of a sandal-strap plus his height. Then he prayed Maghrib when the sun had set. Then he prayed 'Isha' when the twilight disappeared. Then he prayed Fajr when dawn broke. The next day he prayed Zuhr when a man's shadow was equal to his height. Then he prayed 'Asr when a man's shadow was twice his height, and (the time between the prayer and sunset) lasted as long as it takes a swift rider to reach Dhul-Hulaifah. Then he prayed Maghrib when the sun set, then he prayed 'Isha' when one-third or one-half of the night had passed'\" - (One of the narrators) Zaid, was not sure - \"then he prayed Fajr when it had become bright",
