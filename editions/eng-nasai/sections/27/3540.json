Rather it (the mourning period) is four months and ten days.\" I (the narrator) said to Zainab: \"What does 'after a year had passed' mean?\" She said: \"During the Jahiliyyah, if a woman's husband died she would go to the worst room she had and stay there, then, when a year had passed, she would come out and throw a piece of dung behind her",
