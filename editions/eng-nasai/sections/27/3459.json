He said: 'What made you do that?' He said: 'O Prophet of Allah! I saw the whiteness of her calves in the moonlight.' The Prophet said: 'Keep away until you have done what you have to do.' (One of the narrators) Ishaq said in his Hadith: \"Keep away from her until you have done what you have to do.\" The wording is that of Muhammad",
