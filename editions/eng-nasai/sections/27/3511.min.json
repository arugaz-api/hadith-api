He said: 'No, not until the longer of the two periods has ended.' He said: 'Allah says: And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden.' He said: 'That only applies in the case of divorce.' Abu Hurairah said: 'I agree with my brother's son' --meaning, Abu Salamah. He sent his slave Kuraib and told him: 'Go to Umm Salamah and ask her: Was this the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah?' He came back and said: 'Yes, Subai'ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth twenty days after her husband died, and the Messenger of Allah told her to get married, and Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who proposed marriage to her","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":27,"hadith":123}}}
