    "text": "Aishah said that the Messenger of Allah used to stay with Zainab bint Jahsh and drink honey at her house. Hafsah and I agreed that if the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say:\"I perceive the smell of Maghafir (a nasty-smelling gum) on you; have you eaten Maghafir?\" He came in to one of them, and she said that to him. He said: \"No, rather I drank honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I will never do it again.\" Then the following was revealed: 'O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' 'If you two turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you)' about 'Aishah and Hafsah, 'And (remember) when the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives' refers to him saying: \"No, rather I drank honey",
