But eclipses of the sun and the moon do not happen for the death or birth of anyone. Rather they are two of the creations of Allah (SWT) and Allah (SWT) causes to happen in His creation what He wills. Whichever of them becomes eclipsed, pray until it is over or Allah (SWT) causes something to happen",
