{"author":"Sunan an Nasai","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1496,"arabicnumber":1496,"text":"It was narrated that Abdullah bin Amr said:\"The sun eclipsed during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed and stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up and (remained standing) for a long time.\" (One of the narrators) Shu'bh said: \"I think he said something similar concerning prostration.\"- \"He started weeping and blowing during his prostration and said: 'Lord, You did not tell me that You would do that while I am asking You for forgiveness; You did not tell me that You would do that while I was still among them.' When he finished praying he said: \"Paradise was shown to me, and if I had stretched forth my hand I could have taken some of its fruits. And Hell was shown to me, so I started blowing for fear that its heat might overwhelm you. I saw therein the thief who stole the two camels of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); and I saw therein the brother of Banu As-Du'du; the thief who stole from the pilgrims, and when he was caught he said: The crooked stick did it; and I saw therein a tall black woman who was being punished because of a cat she tied up and did not feed or give it water, and she did not let it eat of the vermin of the earth, until it died. Then sun and the moon do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone, but they are two of the signs of Allah. If one of them becomes eclipsed'- or he said: 'if one of them does anything like that'- 'then hasten to remember Allah, the Mighty and Sublime","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":38}}}
