Then he said: \"The sun and the moon do not become eclipsed for the death of anyone, but they are two of His creations. Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, causes whatever He wants to happen in His creation. If Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, manifests Himself to any of His creation, it humbles itself before Him, so if either of them (solar or lunar eclipse) happens, pray until it is over or until Allah causes something to happen","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":29}}}
