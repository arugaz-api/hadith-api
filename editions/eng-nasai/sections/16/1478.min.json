{"author":"Sunan an Nasai","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1478,"arabicnumber":1478,"text":"It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:\"The sun eclipsed during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a very hot day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led his companions in prayer, and he stood for so long that they started to fall over. Then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up (and remained standing) for a long time. Then he bowed again for a long time, then he stood up (again) and (remained standing) for a long time. Then he prostrated twice, then he stood up and did the same again. He started to move forward, then he started to step back. He bowed four times and prostrated four times. They used to say that eclipses of the sun and moon only happened when one of their great men died, but they are two of the signs of Allah (SWT) that He shows to you, so when an eclipse happens, pray until it is over","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":20}}}
