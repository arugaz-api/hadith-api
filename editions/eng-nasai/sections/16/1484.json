In his Khutbah he mentioned a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Samurah bin Jundub said: \"One day a boy from among the Ansar and I were shooting at two targets of ours, during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), when the sun was at a height of two or three spears as it appears to one who is looking at the horizon. The sun turned black, and we said to one another, let us go to the masjid, for by Allah (SWT) this must herald some event concerning the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his ummah. We went to the masjid and we saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) coming out to the people. He went forward and prayed. He stood for the longest time that he had ever stood in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. Then he bowed for the longest time that he had ever bowed in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. Then he prostrated for the longest time that he had ever prostrated in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. The he did likewise in the second rak'ah. And the eclipse ended as he was sitting at the end of the second rak'ah. The he said the salam, then he praised and glorified Allah (SWT), and bore witness that there is none worthy of worship but Allah (SWT) and he bore witness that he was the slave and Messenger of Allah.\" Narrated in abridged form",
