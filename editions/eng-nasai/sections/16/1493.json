    "text": "It was narrated that 'Abdullah bin Abbas said:\"There was an eclipse of the sun and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed and the people with him. He stood for long time reciting something like Surah Al-Baqarah, then he raised (his head) and stood for a long time, then he raised (his head) and stood for a long time which was shorter than the first time. Then he bowed for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he prostrated. Then he got up and stood for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he bowed for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he raised (his head) and stood for a long time, which was shorter than the first time. Then he bowed for a long time, which was shorter than the first time, then he prostrated, then he finished (his prayer) and the sun had been clear. He said: 'The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah (SWT) and they do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that then remember Allah (SWT) the Mighty and Sublime.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we saw you stretching out your hand when you were standing, then we saw you moving backward. He said: 'I saw Paradise-or it was shown to me- and I reached out to a take a bunch of its fruits. If I ha taken it you would have eaten from it for as long as this world lasts. And I saw Hell and I have never seen anything like it, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women.' They said: \"Why, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: 'Because of their ingratitude.' It was said: 'Are they ungrateful to Allah?' He said: 'They are ungrateful to their husbands and they are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you are kind to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees (one) bad thing from you, she will say: I have never seen anything good from you",
