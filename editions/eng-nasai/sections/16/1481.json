He stood for a long time in prayer,\" and 'Aishah said: \"I thought that he recited Surah Al-Baqarah. Then he bowed for a long time, then he said: Sami' Allahu liman hamidah. Then he bowed, then prostrated. Then he stood up and did the same again, bowing twice and prostrating once. Then he sat and the eclipse ended",
