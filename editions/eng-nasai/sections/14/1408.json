The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: 'Have you prayed?\" He said: 'No.\" He said: 'Pray two rak'ahs.' And he urged the people to give in charity. They gave clothes, and he gave him two garments. The following Friday, he came when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was delivering the khutbah, and he urged the people to give charity. (That man) gave one of his two garments and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'This man came last Friday looking shabby, and I commanded the people to give charity and they gave clothes, and I said that he should be given two garments, and now he came and I commanded the people to give charity and he gave one of them. So he chided him and said: Take your garment",
