Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the taslim and they all said the taslim. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had prayed two rak'ahs and each of the two groups had prayed two rak'ahs","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":18,"hadith":15}}}
