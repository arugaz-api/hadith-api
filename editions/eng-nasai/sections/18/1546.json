The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and one group stood behind him while another group faced the enemy. He led those who were behind him in prayer, bowing once and prostrating twice. Then they went and took the place of those who had been facing the enemy, and that group came and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led them in prayer, bowing once and prostrating twice. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the taslim and those who were behind him said the taslim, as did the other group",
