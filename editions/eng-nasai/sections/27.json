He called Hilal and he bore witness four times by Allah that he was telling the truth, and the fifth time he invoked the curse of Allah upon him if he were lying. Then he called the woman and she bore witness four times by Allah that he was lying. When it came to the fourth or fifth time, the Messenger of Allah said: 'Stop her, for it will inevitably bring the punishment of Allah upon the liar.' She hesitated until we thought that she was going to confess, then she said: 'I will not dishonor my people today.' Then she went ahead with the oath. The Messenger of Allah said: 'Wait and see. If she produces a child who is white, with straight hair and Qadiy'a eyes, then he belongs to Hilal bin Umayyah, but if she produces a child who is dark with curly hair, of average size and with narrow calves, then he belongs to Sharik bin As-Sahma'.'
