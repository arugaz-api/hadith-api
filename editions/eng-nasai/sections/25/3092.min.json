Whoever says La ilaha illallah, his life and his property are safe from me, except for its right, and his reckoning will be with Allah?'\" Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"I will surely fight those who separate prayer and Zakah, for Zakah is what is due on wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a small she-goat that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) I will fight them for withholding it.' ('Umar said) 'By Allah, when I realized that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, had opened the chest of Abu Bakr to fighting, then I knew that it was the truth.'\" The wording is that of Ahmad","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":8}}}
