    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Ad-Darda' said:\"The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: 'Whoever established Salah, pays Zakah, and dies not associating anything with Allah, he has a right from Allah the Mighty and Sublime, that He will forgive him, whether he emigrated, or died in his birthplace.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Shall we not tell the people about it so that they may rejoice?' He said: 'In Paradise there are one hundred levels, (the distance) between each two of which is like (the distance) between the Heaven and the Earth; Allah has prepared them fro the Mujahidin who strive in His cause. Were it not that it would be too difficult for the believers and I cannot find mounts for them - and they do not like to stay behind if I go out (on a campaign) - I would not have stayed behind from any expedition. I wish that I could be killed then brought back to life, then killed again",
