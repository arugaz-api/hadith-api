    "text": "It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said:\"On the day of Uhud, the people ran away, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in one position among twelve men of the Ansar, one of whom was Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah. He said: 'Who will face the people?' Talhah said: 'I will.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Stay where you are.' One of the Ansar said: 'I will, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' He said: 'You (go ahead).' So he fought until he was killed. Then he turned and saw the idolators. He said: 'Who will face the people?' Talhah said: 'I will'. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Stay where you are.' One of the Ansar said: 'I will, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' He said: 'You (go ahead).' So he fought until he was killed. This carried on, and each man of the Ansar went out to face them and fought like the one before him, and was killed, until only the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah were left. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Who will face the people?' Talhah said: 'I will.' So Talhah fought like the eleven before him, until his hand was struck, and his fingers were cut off, and he exclaimed in pain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'If you had said Bismillah (in the Name of Allah), the angels would have lifted you up with the people looking on.' Then Allah drove back the idolators",
