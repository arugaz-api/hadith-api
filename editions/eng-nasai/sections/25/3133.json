And I am a guarantor, for the one who believes in me and accepts Islam, and strives in the cause of Allah: A house on the outskirts of Paradise and a house in the middle of Paradise and a house in the highest chambers of Paradise. Whoever does that and seeks goodness wherever it is, and avoids evil wherever it is, may die wherever he wants to die",
