    "text": "It was narrated that 'Abdullah said:\"Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him regularly attend these five (daily) prayers whenever the call for them is given (that in the mosques), for Allah prescribed for His Prophet the ways of guidance, and they (the prayers) are part of those ways of guidance. I do not think that there is anyone among you who does not have a place where he prays in his house. But if you were to pray in your houses and forsake the Masjids, you would be forsaking the Sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to forsake the Sunnah of your Prophet you would go astray. There is no Muslim slave who performs Wudu and does it well, then walks to the prayer, but Allah will record one Hasanah (good deed) for each step he takes, or raise' him one level by it or erase one sin from him. I remember how we used to take short steps, and I remember (a time) when no one stayed behind from the prayer except a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known. And I have seen a man coming Supported by two others until he would be made to stand in the row",
