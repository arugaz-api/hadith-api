He said: 'Tell a Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer.' I said to Hafsah: 'Tell him.' So she told him. He said: 'You are (like) the female companions of Yosuf. Tell Abu Bakr lead the people in prayer.\"' She said: \"So they told Abu Bakr. When he started to pray, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to feel better, so he got up and came with the help of two men, with his feet dragging along the ground. (When) he entered the Masjid, Abu Bakr heard him coming and he wanted to step back, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured to him: 'Stay where you are.' Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and sat on Abu Bakr's left, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was leading the people in prayer sitting, and Abu Bakr was standing and following the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the people were following the prayer of Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":57}}}
