    "text": "Muslim bin Yasar and 'Abdullah bin 'Ubaid said:\"Ubadah bin As-Samit and Muawiyah met at a stopping place on the road. 'Ubadah said: 'The Messenger of Allah forbade us to sell gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates\"' - one of them said: \"salt for salt, \" but the other did not say \"unless it was equal amount for equal amount, like for like.\" One of them said: \"Whoever gives more or takes more has engaged in Riba,\" but the other one did not say it. \"And the commanded us to sell gold for silver and silver for gold, and wheat for barley and barley for wheat, hand to hand, however we wanted.' News of this hadith reached Muawiyah and he stood up and said: 'What is the matter with men who narrate Hadiths from the Messenger of Allah when we accompanied him and we never heard him say it? News of that reached 'Ubadah bin As-Samit and he stood up and repeated the Hadith, then he said: 'We will narrate what we heard from the Messenger of Allah, whether Muawiyah likes it or not.\"' Qatadah contradicted him, he reported it from Muslim bin Yasar, from Abu Al-=Ashath, from 'Ubadah",
