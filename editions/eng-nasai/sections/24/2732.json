    "text": "It was narrated from Salim bin 'Abdullah that 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said; \"during the Farewell Pilgrimage, the Messenger of Allah benefited from performing 'Umrah and then Hajj, and he brought a Hadi (sacrificial animal )with him from dhul-Hulaifah. The Messenger of Allah entered Ihram for 'Umrah frist, them for Hajj, and the people also benefited by entering Ihram for 'Umrah first, then for Hajj. Some of the people brought the Hadi and carried it along with them, and other s did not. When the Messenger of Allah came to Makkah, he said to the people:'Whoever among you has brought a Hadi, nothing is permissible for him that became forbidden when he entered Ihram, until he has finished his Hajj, Whoever did not find a Hadi, let him fast for three days during the Hajj, and for seven when he returns to his family, the Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf when he came to Makkah and touched the corner (where the Black Stone is) first of all, then he walked rapidly during the first three of the seven circles, and walked daring the last four. After he finished circumambulating the House he prayed two Rak'ahs at Maqam Ibrahim. Then he went to As-Safa and walked seven rounds between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. And he did not do any action that was forbidden because of Ihram until he had completed his Hajj and slaughtered his Hadi on the Day of sacrifice. Then he hastened onward (toard Makkah) and circumambulated the House. Then everything that had been forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. And those who had brought the Hadi with them did the same as the Messenger of Allah did",
