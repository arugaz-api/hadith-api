    "text": "It was narrated from Muharrar bin Abi Hurairah that his father said:\"I came with Ali bin Abi Talib when the Messenger of Allah sent him to the people of Makkah with news of the dissolution of treaty obligations.\" He said: \"How did you announced that no one would enter Paradise but a believing soul, no one was to circumambulate the House naked: whoever had a treaty with the Messenger of Allah, then for its period, or, it extended to four months, and when four months had passed, and that Allah is free from (all) obligations to the idolaters and so is His Messenger. No idolater was to perform Hajj after this year. I kept on announcing it until my vice grew hoarse",
