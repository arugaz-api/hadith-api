Then he stood near the Maqam and prayed two Rakahs. Then he recited: 'And take you the Maqam (Place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer, raising his voice, so that the people would hear. Then he went (to perform Sai) and said: 'We will start with that with which Allah started.' So he started with As-Safa, climbing up, until he could see the House, and he said three times: 'La ilaha illallah, Wahdahu la sharika lah, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, yuhyi wa yumitu, wa huwaala kulli shayin qadir (There is none worthy of worship except Allah alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and to Him be praise, He gives life and death, and He has power over all things).' Then exclaimed Allah's greatness, then he supplicated as much as was decreed for him. Then he came down walking until he reached level ground at the bottom of the valley. Then he hastened until the ground began to rise. Then he walked until he came to Al-Marwah and clime dup it, and when he could see the House he said: 'La ilaha illallah, Wahdahu la sharika lah, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, yuhyi wa yumitu, wa huwaala kulli shayin qadir (There is none worthy of worship except Allah alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and to Him be praise, He gives life and death, and He has power over all things).' He said that three times, then he remembered Allah and glorified and praised Him, then he supplicated there for as long as Allah willed. And he did that until he finished Sai","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":344}}}
