    "text": "It was narrated that 'Aishah said:\"We set out with the Messenger of Allah for the Farewell Pligrimage and we entered Ihram for 'Umrah, then the Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever has a Hadi with him, let him enter Ihram for both Hajj and 'Umrah, then do not exit Ihram until he exits Ihram for them both.' I came to Makkah and I had my menses, so I did not circumambulate the House or (Perform Sa'i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. I complained about that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: 'Undo your hair, and comb it, and enter Ihram for Hajj, and leave 'Umrah.' When I had completed Hajj, the Messenger of Allah sent me with 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr to At-Tan'im, and I performed 'Umrah. He said: 'This is the place of your 'Umrah.' Then those who had entered Ihram for 'Umar circumambulated the House and (performed Sa'i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. Then they exited Ihram, then they performed Tawaf again, after they came back from Mina for their Hajj. As for those who combined Hajj and 'Umrah, they only performed one Tawaf",
