    "text": "It was narrated from Al-Bara bin Azib that:if one of them went to sleep before eating supper, it was not permissible for him to eat or drink anything that night or the following day, until the sun had set. (That continued) until this Verse was revealed: \"And eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night).\" He said: \"This was revealed concerning Abu Qais bin 'Amr who came to his family after Maghrib when he was fasting, and said: 'Is there anything to eat?\" His wife said: 'No , but I will go out, and he lay down and slept. She came back and found him sleeping, so she woke him up, but he did not eat anything. He spent the night fasting and woke up the next day fasting, until he passed out at midday. That was before this Verse was revealed, and Allah revealed it concerning him",
