The Messenger of Allah was reclining amid his Companions, and we said to him: This white man who is reclining.' The man said to him: 'O son of 'Abdul-Muttalib.' The Messenger of Allah said: ' I have answered you.' The man said; 'O Muhammad, I am going to ask you questions, and I will be harsh in asking; do not get upset.; The man said: 'I adjure you by your Lord and the Lord of those who cam before you, has Allah sent you to all the people?' The Messenger of Allah said: 'By Allah, yes.' He said; 'I adjure you by Allah, has Allah commanded you to offer five prayers each day and night?' The Messenger of Allah said: 'By Allah, yes.; He said: 'I adjure you by Allah, has Allah commanded you to fast this month each year? The Messenger of Allah said: 'By Allah, Yes.' He said: 'I adjure you by Allah, has Allah commanded you to take this charity from our rich and distribute it among our poor?' The Messenger of Allah said. 'By Allah, yes.' The man said: 'I believe in that which you have brought, and I am the envoy of my people who are coming after me. I am Dimam bin Thalabah, the brother of Banu sad bin Bakr.\"' Yaqub bin Ibrahim contradicted him",
