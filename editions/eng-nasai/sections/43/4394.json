And the members of my household,; or my family and my neighbors,; The Messenger of Allah said; 'Offer another sacrifice,; He said: 'I have a suckling she-goat kid that is dearer to me than two sheep raised for meat,' He said: 'Sacrifice it, for it is the better of your two sacrifices. But no Jadh'ah will do as a sacrifice for anyone after you.\"' (Sahih)",
