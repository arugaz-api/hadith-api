The parable of a believer who does not read the Qur'an is that of a date, the taste of which is good but it has no smell. The parable of a hypocrite who reads the Qur'an is that of basil, the smell of which is good but its taste is bitter. And the parable of a hypocrite who does not read the Qur'an is that of a colocynth (bitter-apple), the taste of which is bitter and it has no smell",
