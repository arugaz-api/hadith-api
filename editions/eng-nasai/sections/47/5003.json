If they bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, they turn to face the same Qiblah as us, they eat our slaughtered animals, and they pray as we pray; then their blood and their wealth are forbidden to us, except for a right that is due, and they have the same rights and duties as the Muslims",
