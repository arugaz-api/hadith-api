    "text": "Abdullah bin Buraidah narrated from his father:That he was in a gathering where the Messenger of Allah was present and he said: \"I used to forbid you to eat the sacrificial mea for more than three days, but now eat it, give it to others and store it for as long as you want. And I told you not to make Nabidh in these containers: Ad-Dubba', Al-Muzaqqat, An-Naqir, and Al-Hantam. But now make Nabidh in whatever you want, but avoid everything that intoxicates. And I forbade you to visit graves, but now whoever want to visit them, let him do so, but do not utter anything which is not suitable",
