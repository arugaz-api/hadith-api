When she was halfway to him, he stopped until she reached him, and it was Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah. He said to her: 'What brought you out of your house, O Fatimah?' She said: 'I came to the people of this deceased one to pray for mercy for them, and to offer my condolences to them.' He said: 'Perhaps you went with them to Al-Kuda?\" She said: 'Allah forbid that I should go there. I heard what you said about that.' He said: If you had gone there with them, you would never have seen Paradise until the grandfather of your father saw it",
