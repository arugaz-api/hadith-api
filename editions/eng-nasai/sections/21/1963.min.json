If they said yes, he would pray for him, but if they said no, he would say: \"Pray for your companion.\" Then, when Allah made His Messenger rich through conquest, he said: \"I am closer to the believers than their own selves. Whoever dies and leaves behind a debt, I will pay it, and whoever leavers behind wealth, it is for his heirs","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":146}}}
