    "text": "It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said:\"I stayed overnight with my maternal aunt Maimunah bin Al-Harith, and the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) stayed overnight with her. I saw him get up to relieve himself and he went to the waterskin and undid its string, then he performed wudu and that was moderate (in the amount of water used). Then he went to his bed and slept. Then he got up again and went to the waterskin and undid its string, and performed wudu again, like the first time. Then he stood and prayed, and when he prostrated he said: 'Allahummaj'al fi qalbi nuran waj'al fi sami' nuran waj'al fi basri nuran, waj'al min tahti nuran waj'al min fawqi nuran, wa 'an yamii nuran wa 'an yasari nuran waj'al amami nuran, waj'al khalfi nuran wa a'zimli nura (O Allah, place light in my heart, and place light in my hearing, and place light in my seeing, and place light beneath me, and place light above me, and light on my right, and light on my left, and place light behind me, and make the light greater for me.') Then he slept until he started to snore, then Bilal came and woke him up for the prayer",
