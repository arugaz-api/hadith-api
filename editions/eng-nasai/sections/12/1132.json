    "text": "Awf bin Malik said:\"I prayed Qiyam with the Prophet (ï·º). He started by using the Siwak and performing wudu, then he stood and prayed. He started reciting Al-Baqarah and he did not come to any verse that spoke of mercy but he paused and asked for mercy, and he did not come to any verse that spoke of punishment but he paused (and sought refuge with Allah from that). Then he bowed and he stayed bowing for as long as he had stood,a nd he said while bowing: 'Subhanaka Dhil-jabaraut wal-malakut wal-kibriya' wal-'azamah (Glory be to the One Who has all power, sovereignty, magnificence and might.)' Then he prostrated for as long as he had bowed, saying while prostrating: 'Subhana Dhil-jabarut wal-malakut wal-kibriya' wal-'azamah (Glory be to the One Who has all power, sovereignty, magnificence and might.)' Then he recited Al Imran, then another surah and another, doing that each time",
