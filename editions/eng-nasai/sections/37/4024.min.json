They complained about that to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and he said: \"Why don't you go out with our herdsmen and drink the milk and urine of the camels?\" They said: \"Yes (we will do that).\" They went out and drank some of the (camels') milk and urine, and they recovered. Then they killed the herdsman of the Messenger of Allah [SAW], so he sent (men after them) and they caught them and brought them back. He had their hands and feet cut off and branded their eyes, and left them in the sun to die","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":59}}}
