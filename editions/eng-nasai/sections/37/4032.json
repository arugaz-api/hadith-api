    "text": "Anas bin Malik narrated that:Some people or some men from 'Ukl, or 'Uraynah came to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, we are herdsmen, not tillers,\" the climate of Al-Madinah did not suit them. So the Messenger of Allah [SAW] ordered that they be allocated some camels and a herdsman, and he told them to go out with them and drink their milk and urine. When they recovered and they were in the vicinity of Al-Harrah, they reverted to disbelief after their Islam, killed the herdsman of the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and drove off the camels. He sent (men) after them and they were brought, and he had their eyes gouged out, and their hands and feet cut off. Then he left them in Al-Harrah in that state until they died",
