Then I met Abu Barzah on the day of 'Id, with a number of his companions. I said to him: 'Did you hear the Messenger of Allah [SAW] mention the Khawarij?' He said: 'Yes. I heard the Messenger of Allah [SAW] with my own ears, and saw him with my own eyes. Some wealth was brought to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and he distributed it to those on his right and on his left, but he did not give anything to those who were behind him. Then a man stood behind him and said: \"O Muhammad! You have not been just in your division!\" He was a man with black patchy (shaved) hair, wearing two white garments. So Allah's Messenger [SAW] became very angry and said: \"By Allah! You will not find a man after me who is more just than me.\" Then he said: \"A people will come at the end of time; as if he is one of them, reciting the Qur'an without it passing beyond their throats. They will go through Islam just as the arrow goes through the target. Their distinction will be shaving. They will not cease to appear until the last of them comes with Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal. So when you meet them, then kill them, they are the worst of created beings","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":138}}}
