    "text": "It was narrated that 'Aishah said:\"We went out with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. I (said the Talbiyah) for 'Umrah and I arrived in Makkah while I was menstruating, so I did not perform Tawaf around the House nor between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. I complained about that to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he said: 'Undo your braids and comb your hair, and enter (begin the Talbiyah) for Hajj, and leave the 'Umrah.' So I did that, and then when we had completed Hajj, he sent me with 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr to At-Tan'im, and I performed 'Umrah. He said: 'This is in place of your 'Umrah.'\" Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said: This Hadith is Gharib as a narration of Malik from Hisham, from 'Urwah. No one except Asshab reported it",
