He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade any one of us to comb his hair each day,[1] or to urinate in the place where he performs Ghusl, or for a man to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a women, or a woman to perform Ghusl using the leftover water of a man - they should scoop it out together.'\" [1] It is said this is to prevent him from making his physical appearance his main aim",
