I said: 'By the One Who sent you as a Prophet with the truth, they did not tell me why they wanted to come with me and I did not realize that they were seeking to be appointed as officials.' And I could see his Siwak beneath his lip, then it slipped and he said: 'We do not' - or; 'We will never appoint as an official anyone who seeks that. Rather you should go.'\" So he sent his (Abu Musa) to Yemen, then he sent Mu'adh bin Jabal to go after him - may Allah be pleased with them","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":4}}}
