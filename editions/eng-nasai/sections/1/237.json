She said: 'Yes, if she is well-mannered.[1] I remember the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) and I performing Ghusl from a single wash tub. We would pour water on our hands until they were clean then pour water over them.'\" Al-A'raj said: \"Not mentioning the private area not paying attention to it.\" [1] Kaiysah:\" Well-mannered when using the water with the man\" (An-Nihayah) And the comments by Al-A'raj after the narration refer to its meaning",
