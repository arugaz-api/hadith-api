When he saw me coming he said: 'They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!' I said: 'what's happening? Perhaps something has been revealed concerning me.' I said: 'Who are they, may my father said mother be ransomed for you?' He said: \"those who have a lot of wealth, except one who does like this, and like this, and like this,' (motioning) in front of him, and to his right, and to his left. Then he said: 'By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no man dies leaving camels, or cattle, or sheep on which he did not pay the Zakah, but they will come on the Day of Resurrection as big and fat as they ever were, trampling him with their hooves and goring him with their horns. Every time the last of them runs over him, the first of them will come back, until judgment is passed among the people","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":6}}}
