He said: 'What I fear most for you after I am gone is the (worldly) delights that will come to you.' And he spoke of this world and its attractions. A man said: 'Can good bring forth evil? 'The Messenger of Allah remained silent and it was said to him (that man): 'What is the matter with you? You speak to the Messenger of Allah when he does not speak to you? We noticed that he was receiving Revelation. Then he recovered and wiped off his sweat and said: I know what the questioner meant: he means that good never brings forth evil. But some of that which grows in the spring kills the animals or makes them sick, unless they eat Al-Khadir (kind of plant): if they eat their fill or it then turn to face the sun and then defecate and urinate and start to graze again. This wealth is fresh and sweet. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to a Muslim from which he gives to orphans, the poor and wayfarers. The one who takes it unlawfully is like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and who eats but is never satisfied, and it will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":147}}}
