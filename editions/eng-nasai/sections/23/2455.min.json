{"author":"Sunan an Nasai","hadith":{"hadithnumber":2455,"arabicnumber":2455,"text":"It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that Abu Bakar, may Allah be pleased with him, wrote to him:\"This is the obligation of Sadaqah which the Messenger of Allah enjoined upon the Muslims, as Allah commanded the Messenger of Allah Whoever is asked for it in the manner explained (in the letter of Abu Bakar), let him give it, and whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. When there are less than twenty-five camels, for every five camels, one sheep (is to be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then a Bint Makhad (a one-year-old she-camel) is due, up to thirty-five. If a Bint Makhad (a one-year-old male camel). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a Bint Labun (a two-year-old she-camel) is due, up to forty five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a Hiqqah (a three year old she-camel) that was bred by a stallion camel is due, up to sixty. If the number reaches sixty-one, then a Jadh'ah (a four-year-old she-camel) is due, up to seventy-five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two Bint Labun are due, up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two Hiqqahs that have been bred by stallion camels are due, up to one hundred and twenty. If there are more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty a Bint Labun and for every fifty a Hiqqah. In the event that a person does not have a camel of the age specified according to the Sadaqah regulation, then if a person owes a Jadh'ah but he has a Hiqqah, then the Hiqqah should be accepted from him and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Hiqqah as Sadaqah but he only has a Jadh'ah, then it shold be accepted from him, and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams or two sheep. If a person owes a Hiqqah and does not have one but he has a Bint Labun, it should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it, if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Bint Labun as Sadaqah but he only has a Hiqqah, it should be accepted from him, and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams or two sheep. If a person owes a Bint Labun as Sadaqah and he does not have a Bint Labun, but he has a Bint Makhad. It should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it, if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Bint Makhad as Sadaqah but he only has a Bint Labun, a male, it shold be accepted from him and nothing else (need be given) with it. If a person has only four camels, then nothing is due on them, unless their owner wishes (to give something). With regard to the Sadaqah of grazing sheep, if there are forty then one sheep is due, up to one hundred and twenty. If there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that, then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred one sheep is due, and no decrepit or defecting sheep or male sheep should be taken as Sadaqah unless the Zakah collector wishes. Do not combine separate flocks or separate combined flocks for fear of Sadaqah, Each partner (who has a share in a combined flock) shold pay Sadaqah in proportion to his shares. If a man's flock is one less than forty sheep, then nothing is due from them unless their owner wishes. With regard to silver, one-quarter of one-tenth, and if there are only one hundred and ninety, nothing is due unless the owner wishes","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":21}}}
