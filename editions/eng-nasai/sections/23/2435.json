When you come to them, call them to testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has enjoined on them a charity (Zakah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.
