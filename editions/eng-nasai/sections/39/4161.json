    "text": "It was narrated that 'Ubadah bin As-Samit said:\"While there was a group of his companions around him, the Messenger of Allah said: 'Pledge to me, that you will not associate anything with Allah, nor steal, nor commit unlawful sexual relations, nor kill your children; you will not utter slander, fabricating from between your hands and feet, and you will not disobey me in goodness (Ma'ruf). Whoever fulfills (this pledge), his reward will be with Allah, and whoever commits any of these actions and is punished for it, it will be an expiation for him. Whoever commits any of these actions then Allah conceals him, then his affair is up to Allah; if He wills He will forgive him, and if He wills punish him.\"' (Sahih) Ahmed bin Sa'eed contradicted him",
