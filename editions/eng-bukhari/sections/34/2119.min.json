The angels will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness and blessings for everyone of you so long as he keeps sitting at his praying place. The angels will say, 'O Allah, bless him! O Allah, be merciful to him!' as long as he does not do Hadath or a thing which gives trouble to the other.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further said, \"One is regarded in prayer so long as one is waiting for the prayer","grades":[],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":72}}}
