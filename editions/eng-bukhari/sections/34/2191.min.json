On that, Yahya kept quiet.\" Sufyan said, \"I meant that Jabir belonged to Medina.\" Sufyan was asked whether in Jabir's narration there was any prohibition of selling fruits before their benefit is evident (i.e. no dangers of being spoilt or blighted). He replied that there was none","grades":[],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":138}}}
