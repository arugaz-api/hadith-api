The Prophet came up to me and said, \"O Jabir.\" I replied, \"Yes?\" He said, \"What is the matter with you?\" I replied, \"My camel is slow and tired, so I am left behind.\" So, he got down and poked the camel with his stick and then ordered me to ride. I rode the camel and it became so fast that I had to hold it from going ahead of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . He then asked me, have you got married?\" I replied in the affirmative. He asked, \"A virgin or a matron?\" I replied, \"I married a matron.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Why have you not married a virgin, so that you may play with her and she may play with you?\" Jabir replied, \"I have sisters (young in age) so I liked to marry a matron who could collect them all and comb their hair and look after them.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You will reach, so when you have arrived (at home), I advise you to associate with your wife (that you may have an intelligent son).\" Then he asked me, \"Would you like to sell your camel?\" I replied in the affirmative and the Prophet (ﷺ) purchased it for one Uqiya of gold. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached before me and I reached in the morning, and when I went to the mosque, I found him at the door of the mosque. He asked me, \"Have you arrived just now?\" I replied in the affirmative. He said, \"Leave your camel and come into (the mosque) and pray two rak`at.\" I entered and offered the prayer. He told Bilal to weigh and give me one Uqiya of gold. So Bilal weighed for me fairly and I went away. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent for me and I thought that he would return to me my camel which I hated more than anything else. But the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, \"Take your camel as well as its price","grades":[],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":50}}}
