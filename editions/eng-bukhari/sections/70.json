He entered his house and interpreted it to me. (Then I went out and) after walking for a short distance, I fell on my face because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw Allah's Apostle standing by my head. He said, \"O Abu Huraira!\" I replied, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and Sadaik!\" Then he held me by the hand, and made me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He took me to his house, and ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drank thereof and he said, \"Drink more, O Abu Hirr!\" So I drank again, whereupon he again said, \"Drink more.\" So I drank more till my belly became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met 'Umar and mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, \"Somebody, who had more right than you, O 'Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I asked you to recite a Verse to me while I knew it better than you.\" On that Umar said to me, \"By Allah, if I admitted and entertained you, it would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels",

The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that it be crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah's Apostle said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added, \"Admit ten (men).\" So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, \"Admit ten (more).\" They were admitted, ate their full, and went out. He then again said, \"Admit ten more!\" They were admitted, ate their fill, and went out.

I asked him to give me one year respite, but he refused.

I will not grant him respite.\" When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw the Jew's attitude, he stood up and walked all around the garden and came again and talked to the Jew, but the Jew refused his request. I got up and brought some ripe fresh dates and put it in front of the Prophet. He ate and then said to me, \"Where is your hut, O Jabir?\" I informed him, and he said, \"Spread out a bed for me in it.\" I spread out a bed, and he entered and slept. When he woke up, I brought some dates to him again and he ate of it and then got up and talked to the Jew again, but the Jew again refused his request. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) got up for the second time amidst the palm trees loaded with fresh dates, and said, \"O Jabir! Pluck dates to repay your debt.\" The Jew remained with me while I was plucking the dates, till I paid him all his right, yet there remained extra quantity of dates.
