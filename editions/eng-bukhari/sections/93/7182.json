    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) `Utba bin Abi Waqqas said to his brother Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, \"The son of the slave girl of Zam`a is from me, so take him into your custody.\" So in the year of Conquest of Mecca, Sa`d took him and said. (This is) my brother's son whom my brother has asked me to take into my custody.\" `Abd bin Zam`a got up before him and said, (He is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, and was born on my father's bed.\" So they both submitted their case before Allah's Apostle. Sa`d said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This boy is the son of my brother and he entrusted him to me.\" `Abd bin Zam`a said, \"This boy is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, and was born on the bed of my father.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"The boy is for you, O `Abd bin Zam`a!\" Then Allah's Apostle further said, \"The child is for the owner of the bed, and the stone is for the adulterer,\" He then said to Sauda bint Zam`a, \"Veil (screen) yourself before him,\" when he saw the child's resemblance to `Utba. The boy did not see her again till he met Allah",
