Saba'na! \" Khalid kept on killing some of them and taking some others as captives, and he gave a captive to everyone of us and ordered everyone of us to kill his captive. I said, \"By Allah, I shall not kill my captive and none of my companions shall kill his captive!\" Then we mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said, \"O Allah! I am free from what Khalid bin Al-Walid has done,\" and repeated it twice",
