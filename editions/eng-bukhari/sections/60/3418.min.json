So fast (sometimes) and do not fast (sometimes). Pray and sleep. Fast for three days a month, for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten time, and so the fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I can do (fast) more than this.\" He said, \"Fast on every third day. I said: I can do (fast) more than that, He said: \"Fast on alternate days and this was the fasting of David which is the most moderate sort of fasting.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I can do (fast) more than that.\" He said, \"There is nothing better than that","grades":[],"reference":{"book":60,"hadith":90}}}
