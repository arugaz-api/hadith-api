{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":3415,"arabicnumber":3415,"text":"Narrated Abu Huraira:Once while a Jew was selling something, he was offered a price that he was not pleased with. So, he said, \"No, by Him Who gave Moses superiority over all human beings!\" Hearing him, an Ansari man got up and slapped him on the face and said, \"You say: By Him Who Gave Moses superiority over all human beings although the Prophet (Muhammad) is present amongst us!\" The Jew went to the Prophet and said, \"O Abu-l-Qasim! I am under the assurance and contract of security, so what right does so-and-so have to slap me?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked the other, \"Why have you slapped\". He told him the whole story. The Prophet (ﷺ) became angry, till anger appeared on his face, and said, \"Don't give superiority to any prophet amongst Allah's Prophets, for when the trumpet will be blown, everyone on the earth and in the heavens will become unconscious except those whom Allah will exempt. The trumpet will be blown for the second time and I will be the first to be resurrected to see Moses holding Allah's Throne. I will not know whether the unconsciousness which Moses received on the Day of Tur has been sufficient for him, or has he got up before me. And I do not say that there is anybody who is better than Yunus bin Matta","grades":[],"reference":{"book":60,"hadith":87}}}
