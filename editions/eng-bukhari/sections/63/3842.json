The slave said to him, \"Do you know what this is?\" Abu Bakr then enquired, \"What is it?\" The slave said, \"Once, in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance I foretold somebody's future though I did not know this knowledge of foretelling but I, cheated him, and when he met me, he gave me something for that service, and that is what you have eaten from.\" Then Abu Bakr put his hand in his mouth and vomited whatever was present in his stomach",
