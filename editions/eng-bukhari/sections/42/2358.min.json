And man displayed his goods for sale after the `Asr prayer and he said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and buys them). The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: \"Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths","grades":[],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":7}}}
