{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":7447,"arabicnumber":7447,"text":"Narrated Abu Bakra:The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Time has come back to its original state which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth, the year is twelve months, of which four are sacred; (and out of these four) three are in succession, namely, Dhul-Qa'da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth one) Rajab Mudar which is between Jumad (Ath-Tham) and Sha'ban.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked us, \"Which month is this?\" We said, \"Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.\" He kept quiet so long that we thought he might call it by another name. Then he said, \"Isn't it Dhul-Hijja?\" We said, \"Yes.\" He asked \"What town is this?\" We said, \"Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.' Then he kept quiet so long that we thought he might call it by another name. He then said, \"Isn't it the (forbidden) town (Mecca)?\" We said, \"Yes.\" He asked, \"What is the day today?\" We said, \"Allah and His Apostle know (it) better. Then he kept quiet so long that we thought that he might call it by another name. Then he said, \"Isn't it the Day of An-Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifices)?\" We said, \"Yes.\" Then he said, \"Your blood (lives), your properties,\" (the sub narrator Muhammad, said: I think he also said): \"..and your honor) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this Day of yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours. You shall meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Don't go astray after me by striking the necks of one another. Lo! It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform it to those who are absent for perhaps the informed one might comprehend it (understand it) better than some of the present audience.\" Whenever the sub-narrator Muhammad mentioned that statement, he would say, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) said the truth.\") And then the Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Allah's Message to you! No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Allah's Message to you?","grades":[],"reference":{"book":97,"hadith":73}}}
