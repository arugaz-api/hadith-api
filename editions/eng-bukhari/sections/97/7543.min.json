The Prophet (ﷺ) asked the Jews, \"What do you (usually) do with them?\" They said, \"We blacken their faces and disgrace them.\" He said, \"Bring here the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful.\" They (fetched it and) came and asked a one-eyed man to recite. He went on reciting till he reached a portion on which he put his hand. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Lift up your hand!\" He lifted his hand up and behold, there appeared the verse of Ar-Rajm (stoning of the adulterers to death). Then he said, \"O Muhammad! They should be stoned to death but we conceal this Divine Law among ourselves.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that the two sinners be stoned to death and, and they were stoned to death, and I saw the man protecting the woman from the stones.
