(Let me join) the Highest Companions (see Qur'an 4:69),\" I said, \"So, he does not choose us.\" Then I realized that it was the application of the statement he used to relate to us when he was healthy. So that was his last utterance (before he died), i.e. \"O Allah! (Let me join) the Highest Companions","grades":[],"reference":{"book":80,"hadith":45}}}
