    "text": "Narrated Jarir:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me. \"Will you relieve me from Dhi-al-Khalasa? \" Dhi-al-Khalasa was an idol which the people used to worship and it was called Al-Ka`ba al Yamaniyya. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I am a man who can't sit firm on horses.\" So he stroked my chest (with his hand) and said, \"O Allah! Make him firm and make him a guiding and well-guided man.\" So I went out with fifty (men) from my tribe of Ahrnas. (The sub-narrator, Sufyan, quoting Jarir, perhaps said, \"I went out with a group of men from my nation.\") and came to Dhi-al-Khalasa and burnt it, and then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have not come to you till I left it like a camel with a skin disease.\" The Prophet then invoked good upon Ahmas and their cavalry (fighters)",
