The rich people have got the highest degrees of prestige and the permanent pleasures (in this life and the life to come in the Hereafter).\" He said, \"How is that?\" They said, \"The rich pray as we pray, and strive in Allah's Cause as we do, and spend from their surplus wealth in charity, while we have no wealth (to spend likewise).\" He said, \"Shall I not tell you a thing, by doing which, you will catch up with those who are ahead of you and supersede those who will come after you; and nobody will be able to do such a good deed as you do except the one who does the same (deed as you do). That deed is to recite 'Subhan Allah ten times, and 'Al-Hamduli l-lah ten times, and 'AllahuAkbar' ten times after every prayer","grades":[],"reference":{"book":80,"hadith":26}}}
