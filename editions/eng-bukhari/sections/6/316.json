    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:In the last Hajj of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I assumed the Ihram for Hajj along with Allah Apostle. I was one of those who intended Tamattu` (to perform Hajj and `Umra) and did not take the Hadi (animal for sacrifice) with me. I got my menses and was not clean till the night of `Arafa I said, \"O Allah's Apostle! It is the night of the day of `Arafat and I intended to perform the Hajj Tamattu` with `Umra. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told me to undo my hair and comb it and to postpone the `Umra. I did the same and completed the Hajj. On the night of Al-Hasba (i.e. place outside Mecca where the pilgrims go after finishing all the ceremonies of Hajj at Mina) he (the Prophet) ordered `Abdur Rahman (`Aisha's brother) to take me to at-Tan`im to assume the lhram for `Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-at-Tamattu` which I had intended to perform",
