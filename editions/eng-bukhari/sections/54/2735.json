    "text": "Narrated `Amra:Aisha said that Barirah came to seek her help in the writing of her emancipation. `Aisha said to her, \"If you wish, I will pay your masters (your price) and the wala' will be for me.\" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, she told him about it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to her, \"Buy her (i.e. Barirah) and manumit (free) her, for the Wala is for the one who manumits.\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ascended the pulpit and said, \"What about those people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah's Laws? Whoever stipulates such conditions as are not in Allah's Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he stipulated a hundred such conditions",
