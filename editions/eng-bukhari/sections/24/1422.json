One day I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) with a complaint. My father Yazid had taken some gold coins for charity and kept them with a man in the mosque (to give them to the poor) But I went and took them and brought them to him (my father). My father said, \"By Allah! I did not intend to give them to you. \" I took (the case) to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Yazid, you will be rewarded for what you intended. O Ma'n, whatever you have taken is yours",
