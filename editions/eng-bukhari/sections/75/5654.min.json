{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":5654,"arabicnumber":5654,"text":"Narrated `Aisha:When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal got a fever. I entered upon them and asked, \"O my father! How are you? O Bilal! How are you?\" Whenever fever attacked Abu Bakr, he would recite the following poetic verses: 'Everybody is staying alive among his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe laces.\" And whenever the fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic lines): 'Would that I could stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that one day I would drink of the water of Majinna and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me.' Then I came and informed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about that, whereupon he said, \"O Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it healthy and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and take away its fever and put it in Al Juhfa","grades":[],"reference":{"book":75,"hadith":14}}}
