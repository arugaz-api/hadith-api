    "text": "Narrated Anas bin Malik:Abu Talha had the greatest wealth of date-palms amongst the Ansar in Medina, and he prized above all his wealth (his garden) Bairuha', which was situated opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ). The Prophet used to enter It and drink from its fresh water. When the following Divine Verse came:-- \"By no means shall you attain piety until you spend of what you love,\" (3.92) Abu Talha got up saying. \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah says, 'You will not attain piety until you spend of what you love,' and I prize above al I my wealth, Bairuha' which I want to give in charity for Allah's Sake, hoping for its reward from Allah. So you can use it as Allah directs you.\" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives.\" On that Abu Talha said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will do (as you have suggested).\" So, Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and cousins",
