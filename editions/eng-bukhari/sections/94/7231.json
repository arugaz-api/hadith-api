    "text": "Narrated Aisha:One night the Prophet (ﷺ) was unable to sleep and said, \"Would that a righteous man from my companions guarded me tonight.\" Suddenly we heard the clatter of arms, whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Who is it?\" It was said, \"I am Sa`d, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have come to guard you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then slept so soundly that we heard him snoring. Abu `Abdullah said: `Aisha said: Bilal said, \"Would that I but stayed overnight in a valley with Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of grass) around me (i.e., in Mecca).\" Then I told that to the Prophet (ﷺ)",
