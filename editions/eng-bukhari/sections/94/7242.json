When I sleep (at night), my Lord makes me eat and drink. But when the people refused to give up Al-Wisal, he fasted Al-Wisal along with them for two days and then they saw the crescent whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If the crescent had not appeared I would have fasted for a longer period,\" as if he intended to punish them herewith",
