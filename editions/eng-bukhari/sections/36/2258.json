Meanwhile Abu Rafi`, the freed slave of the Prophet (ﷺ) came and asked Sa`d to buy from him the (two) dwellings which were in his house. Sa`d said, \"By Allah I will not buy them.\" Al- Miswar said, \"By Allah, you shall buy them.\" Sa`d replied, \"By Allah, I will not pay more than four thousand (Dirhams) by installments.\" Abu Rafi` said, \"I have been offered five hundred Dinars (for it) and had I not heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'The neighbor has more right than anyone else because of his nearness, I would not give them to you for four-thousand (Dirhams) while I am offered five-hundred Dinars (one Dinar equals ten Dirhams) for them.\" So, he sold it to Sa`d",
