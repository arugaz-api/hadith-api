    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:Aflah, the brother of Abi Al-Qu`ais, asked permission to visit me after the order of Al-Hijab was revealed. I said, \"I will not permit him unless I take permission of the Prophet (ﷺ) about him for it was not the brother of Abi Al-Qu`ais but the wife of Abi Al-Qu`ais that nursed me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon me, and I said to him, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Aflah, the brother of Abi Al-Qu`ais asked permission to visit me but I refused to permit him unless I took your permission.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What stopped you from permitting him? He is your uncle.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The man was not the person who had nursed me, but the woman, the wife of Abi Al-Qu`ais had nursed me.\" He said, \"Admit him, for he is your uncle. Taribat Yaminuki (may your right hand be saved)\" `Urwa, the sub-narrator added: For that `Aisha used to say, \"Consider those things which are illegal because of blood relations as illegal because of the corresponding foster relations",
