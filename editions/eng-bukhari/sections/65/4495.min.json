In my opinion it is not sinful for one not to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.\" `Aisha said, \"Your interpretation is wrong for as you say, the Verse should have been: \"So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj or Umra to the House, not to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.' This Verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who (during the Pre-Islamic Period) used to visit Manat (i.e. an idol) after assuming their Ihram, and it was situated near Qudaid (i.e. a place at Mecca), and they used to regard it sinful to ambulate between Safa and Marwa after embracing Islam. When Islam came, they asked Allah's Messenger (ï·º) about it, whereupon Allah revealed:-- \"Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah. So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj of the House (of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":22}}}
