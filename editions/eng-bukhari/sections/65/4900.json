If we return (to Medina), surely, the more honorable will expel the meaner amongst them.\" I reported that (saying) to my uncle or to `Umar who, in his turn, informed the Prophet (ﷺ) of it.

I stayed at home and my uncle said to me. \"You just wanted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to disbelieve your statement and hate you.\" So Allah revealed (the Sura beginning with) 'When the hypocrites come to you.' (63.1) The Prophet (ﷺ) then sent for me and recited it and said, \"O Zaid! Allah confirmed your statement",
