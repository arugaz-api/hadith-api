(Help!)\" The emigrant said, \"O the emigrants! (Help).\" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard that, he said, \"What is that?\" They said, \"A man from the emigrants kicked a man from the Ansar (on the buttocks his foot). On that the Ansar said, 'O the Ansar!' and the emigrant said, 'O the emigrants!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said' \"Leave it (that call) for it Is a detestable thing.\" The number of Ansar was larger (than that of the emigrants) at the time when the Prophet (ﷺ) came to Medina, but later the number of emigrants increased. `Abdullah bin Ubai said, \"Have they, (the emigrants) done so? By Allah, if we return to Medina, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner,\" `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Let me chop off the head of this hypocrite!\" The Prophet said, \"Leave him, lest the people say Muhammad kills his companions:",
