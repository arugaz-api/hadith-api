He said to me. \"I will not pay you your debt till you disbelieve in Muhammad.\" I said, \"I will not disbelieve in Muhammad till you die and then be resurrected.\" He said, \"Will I be resurrected after my death? If so, I shall pay you (there) if I should find wealth and children.\" So there was revealed:-- 'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our Signs, and yet says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children? Has he, known to the unseen or has he taken a covenant from (Allah) the Beneficent? Nay ! We shall record what he says, and we shall add and add to his punishment. And We shall inherit from him all that he talks of, and he shall appear before Us alone","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":257}}}
