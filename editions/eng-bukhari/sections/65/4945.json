He said, \"There is none of you but has his place written for him in Paradise or in the Hell- Fire.\" They said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Shall we depend (on this fact and give up work)?\" He said, \"Carry on doing (good deeds), for every body will find it easy to do (what will lead him to his destined place).\" Then he recited: 'As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah, and believes in the Best reward from Allah (i.e. Allah will compensate him for what he will spend in Allah's way). So, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who is a greedy miser....for him, the path for evil",
