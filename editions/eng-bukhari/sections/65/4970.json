(110.1) Some of them said, \"We are ordered to praise Allah and ask for His forgiveness when Allah's Help and the conquest (of Mecca) comes to us.\" Some others kept quiet and did not say anything.

Allah said:-- '(O Muhammad) When comes the Help of Allah (to you against your enemies) and the conquest (of Mecca) (which is the sign of your death). You should celebrate the praises of your Lord and ask for His Forgiveness, and He is the One Who accepts the repentance and forgives.' (110.3) On that `Umar said, \"I do not know anything about it other than what you have said",
