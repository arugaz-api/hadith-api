    "text": "Narrated Aisha:The Prophet (ﷺ) used to offer prayer at night (for such a long time) that his feet used to crack. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why do you do it since Allah has forgiven you your faults of the past and those to follow?\" He said, \"Shouldn't I love to be a thankful slave (of Allah)?' When he became old, he prayed while sitting, but if he wanted to perform a bowing, he would get up, recite (some other verses) and then perform the bowing",
