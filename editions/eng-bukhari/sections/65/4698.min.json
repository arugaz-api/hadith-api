Its leaves do not fall and it does not, and does not, and does not, and it gives its fruits every now and then.\" It came to my mind that such a tree must be the date palm, but seeing Abu Bakr and `Umar saying nothing, I disliked to speak. So when they did not say anything, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"It is the date-palm tree.\" When we got up (from that place), I said to `Umar, \"O my father! By Allah, it came to my mind that it must be the date palm tree.\" `Umar said, \"What prevented you from speaking\" I replied, \"I did not see you speaking, so I misliked to speak or say anything.\" `Umar then said, \"If you had said it, it would have been dearer to me than so-and-so","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":220}}}
