    "text": "Narrated Al-Aswad:While we were sitting in a circle in `Abdullah's gathering, Hudhaifa came and stopped before us, and greeted us and then said, \"People better than you became hypocrites.\" Al-Aswad said: I testify the uniqueness of Allah! Allah says: \"Verily! The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire.\" (4.145) On that `Abdullah smiled and Hudhaifa sat somewhere in the Mosque. `Abdullah then got up and his companions (sitting around him) dispersed. Hudhaifa then threw a pebble at me (to attract my attention). I went to him and he said, \"I was surprised at `Abdullah's smile though he understood what I said. Verily, people better than you became hypocrite and then repented and Allah forgave them",
