When I went to him, he said, \"What prevented you from coming?\" I said, \"I was praying.\" He said, \"Didn't Allah say\" \"O you who believes Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle.\" (8.24) Then he added, \"Shall I tell you the most superior Sura in the Qur'an before I go out of the mosque?\" When the Prophet (ﷺ) intended to go out (of the Mosque), I reminded him and he said, \"That is: \"Al hamdu-li l-lahi Rabbil-`alamin (Surat-al-fatiha)' which is the seven oft repeated verses (Al-Mathani) and the Grand Qur'an which has been given to me",
