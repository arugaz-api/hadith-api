Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for `Abdullah bin Ubai and his companions. They swore that they did not say anything of that sort Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) deemed their statement true and rejected mine. Thereof I became as distressed as I have never been before, and stayed at home. Then Allah revealed (Surat Al-Munafiqin): 'When the hypocrites come to you.....(63.1) They are the ones who say: Spend nothing on those who are with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ..(63.7) Verily the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner..' (63.7-8) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for me and recited that Sura for me and said, \"Allah has confirmed your statement","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":421}}}
