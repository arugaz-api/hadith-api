    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Umar:While some people were at Quba (offering) morning prayer, a man came to them and said, \"Last night Qur'anic Verses have been revealed whereby the Prophet (ï·º) has been ordered to face the Ka`ba (at Mecca), so you too should face it.\" So they, keeping their postures, turned towards the Ka`ba. Formerly the people were facing Sham (Jerusalem) (Allah said):-- \"And from whence-so-ever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque of Mecca (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram), and whence-so-ever you are, turn your face towards it (when you pray)",
