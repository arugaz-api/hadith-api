    "text": "Narrated `Ali:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent me along with AzZubair and Al-Miqdad and said, \"Proceed till you reach a place called Raudat-Khakh where there is a lady travelling in a howda on a camel. She has a letter. Take the letter from her.\" So we set out, and our horses ran at full pace till we reached Raudat Khakh, and behold, we saw the lady and said (to her), \"Take out the letter!\" She said, \"I have no letter with me.\" We said, \"Either you take out the letter or we will strip you of your clothes.\" So she took the letter out of her hair braid. We brought the letter to the Prophet (ﷺ) and behold, it was addressed by Hatib bin Abi Balta'a to some pagans at Mecca, informing them of some of the affairs of the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What is this, O Hatib?\" Hatib replied, \"Do not be hasty with me, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I am an Ansari man and do not belong to them (Quraish infidels) while the emigrants who were with you had their relatives who used to protect their families and properties at Mecca. So, to compensate for not having blood relation with them.' I intended to do them some favor so that they might protect my relatives (at Mecca), and I did not do this out of disbelief or an inclination to desert my religion.\" The Prophet then said (to his companions), \"He (Hatib) has told you the truth.\" `Umar said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off?\" The Apostle said, \"He is one of those who witnessed (fought in) the Battle of Badr, and what do you know, perhaps Allah looked upon the people of Badr (Badr warriors) and said, 'Do what you want as I have forgiven you.' \" (`Amr, a sub-narrator, said,: This Verse was revealed about him (Hatib): 'O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies as friends or protectors.' (60.1) Narrated `Ali: Sufyan was asked whether (the Verse): 'Take not My enemies and your enemies...' was revealed in connection with Hatib. Sufyan replied, \"This occurs only in the narration of the people. I memorized the Hadith from `Amr, not overlooking even a single letter thereof, and I do not know of anybody who remembered it by heart other than myself",
