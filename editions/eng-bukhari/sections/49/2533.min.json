When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went (to Mecca) at the time of the Conquest, Sa`d took the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and also brought 'Abu bin Zam`a with him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is the son of my brother `Utba who authorized me to take him into my custody.\" 'Abu bin Zam`a said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He is my brother, the son of Zam`a's slave-girl and he was born on his bed.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a and noticed much resemblance (to `Utba). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"It is for you, O 'Abu bin Zam`a as he was born on the bed of your father.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then told Sauda bint Zam`a to observe veil in the presence of the boy as he noticed the boy's resemblance to `Utba and Sauda was the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":17}}}
