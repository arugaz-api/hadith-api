    "text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:That he heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, \"Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for his charge.\" I definitely heard the above from the Prophet (ﷺ) and think that the Prophet (ﷺ) also said, \"A man is a guardian of his father's property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges",
