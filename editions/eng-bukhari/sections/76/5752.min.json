A prophet would pass in front of me with one man, and another with two men, and another with a group of people. and another with nobody with him. Then I saw a great crowd covering the horizon and I wished that they were my followers, but it was said to me, 'This is Moses and his followers.' Then it was said to me, 'Look'' I looked and saw a big gathering with a large number of people covering the horizon. It was said, \"Look this way and that way.' So I saw a big crowd covering the horizon. Then it was said to me, \"These are your followers, and among them there are 70,000 who will enter Paradise without (being asked about their) accounts. \" Then the people dispersed and the Prophet (ﷺ) did not tell who those 70,000 were. So the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) started talking about that and some of them said, \"As regards us, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then we believed in Allah and His Apostle . We think however, that these (70,000) are our offspring.\" That talk reached the Prophet (ﷺ) who said, \"These (70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from (birds) and do not get treated by branding themselves and do not treat with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord.\" then 'Ukasha bin Muhsin got up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Am I one of those (70,000)?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" Then another person got up and said, \"Am I one of them?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \" 'Ukasha has anticipated you","grades":[],"reference":{"book":76,"hadith":67}}}
