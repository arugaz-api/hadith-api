One day while he was with me, he invoked Allah and invoked for a long period and then said, \"O `Aisha! Do you know that Allah has instructed me regarding the matter I asked Him about?\" I asked, \"What is that, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" He said, \"Two men came to me; one of them sat near my head and the other sat near my feet. One of them asked his companion, 'What is the disease of this man?' The other replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The first one asked, 'Who has worked magic on him?\" The other replied, 'Labid bin A'sam, a Jew from the tribe of Bani Zuraiq.' The (first one asked), 'With what has it been done?' The other replied, 'With a a comb and the hair stuck to it and a skin of the pollen of a male datepalm tree.' The first one asked, 'Where is it?' The other replied, 'In the well of Dharwan.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) went along with some of his companions to that well and looked at that and there were date palms near to it. Then he returned to me and said, 'By Allah the water of that well was (red) like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palms were like the heads of devils\" I said, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Did you take those materials out of the pollen skin?\" He said, 'No! As for me Allah has healed me and cured me and I was afraid that (by Showing that to the people) I would spread evil among them when he ordered that the well be filled up with earth, and it was filled up with earth","grades":[],"reference":{"book":76,"hadith":80}}}
