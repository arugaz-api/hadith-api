    "text": "Narrated Anas:Some people were sick and they said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Give us shelter and food. So when they became healthy they said, \"The weather of Medina is not suitable for us.\" So he sent them to Al-Harra with some she-camels of his and said, \"Drink of their milk.\" But when they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet (ﷺ) and drove away his camels. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent some people in their pursuit. Then he got their hands and feet cut and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron. I saw one of them licking the earth with his tongue till he died",
