Then `Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl, Huwaiyisa and Muhaiyisa, the two sons of Mas`ud, came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. `Abdur-Rahman who was the youngest of them all, started talking. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Let the older (among you) speak first.\" So they spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Will fifty of you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man,\" (or said, \"..your companion\"). They said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The murder was a thing we did not witness.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Then the Jews will release you from the oath, if fifty of them (the Jews) should take an oath to contradict your claim.\" They said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! They are disbelievers (and they will take a false oath).\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) himself paid the blood money to them","grades":[],"reference":{"book":78,"hadith":169}}}
