One of them used not to save himself from (being soiled with) the urine, and the other used to go about with calumnies (Namima).\" Then the Prophet asked for a green palm tree leaf and split it into two pieces and placed one piece on each grave, saying, \"I hope that their punishment may be abated as long as these pieces of the leaf are not dried",
