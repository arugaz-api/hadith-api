    "text": "Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr:Abu Bakr invited a group of people and told me, \"Look after your guests.\" Abu Bakr added, I am going to visit the Prophet (ï·º) and you should finish serving them before I return.\" `Abdur-Rahman said, So I went at once and served them with what was available at that time in the house and requested them to eat.\" They said, \"Where is the owner of the house (i.e., Abu Bakr)?\" `Abdur-Rahman said, \"Take your meal.\" They said, \"We will not eat till the owner of the house comes.\" `Abdur-Rahman said, \"Accept your meal from us, for if my father comes and finds you not having taken your meal yet, we will be blamed severely by him, but they refused to take their meals . So I was sure that my father would be angry with me. When he came, I went away (to hide myself) from him. He asked, \"What have you done (about the guests)?\" They informed him the whole story. Abu Bakr called, \"O `Abdur Rahman!\" I kept quiet. He then called again. \"O `Abdur-Rahman!\" I kept quiet and he called again, \"O ignorant (boy)! I beseech you by Allah, if you hear my voice, then come out!\" I came out and said, \"Please ask your guests (and do not be angry with me).\" They said, \"He has told the truth; he brought the meal to us.\" He said, \"As you have been waiting for me, by Allah, I will not eat of it tonight.\" They said, \"By Allah, we will not eat of it till you eat of it.\" He said, I have never seen a night like this night in evil. What is wrong with you? Why don't you accept your meals of hospitality from us?\" (He said to me), \"Bring your meal.\" I brought it to him, and he put his hand in it, saying, \"In the name of Allah. The first (state of fury) was because of Satan.\" So Abu Bakr ate and so did his guests",
