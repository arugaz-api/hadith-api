    "text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered upon me and said, \"Have I not been informed that you offer prayer all the night and fast the whole day?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Do not do so; Offer prayer at night and also sleep; Fast for a few days and give up fasting for a few days because your body has a right on you, and your eye has a right on you, and your guest has a right on you, and your wife has a right on you. I hope that you will have a long life, and it is sufficient for you to fast for three days a month as the reward of a good deed, is multiplied ten times, that means, as if you fasted the whole year.\" I insisted (on fasting more) so I was given a hard instruction. I said, \"I can do more than that (fasting)\" The Prophet said, \"Fast three days every week.\" But as I insisted (on fasting more) so I was burdened. I said, \"I can fast more than that.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Fast as Allah's prophet David used to fast.\" I said, \"How was the fasting of the prophet David?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"One half of a year (i.e. he used to fast on alternate days)",
