The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked for a green leaf of a date-palm tree, split it into two pieces and planted one on each grave and said, \"It is hoped that their punishment may be abated till those two pieces of the leaf get dried.\" (See Hadith No 215, Vol)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":78,"hadith":82}}}
