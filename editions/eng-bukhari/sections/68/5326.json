Her husband divorced her irrevocably and she left (her husband's house).\" `Aisha said, \"What a bad thing she has done!\" 'Urwa said (to `Aisha), \"Haven't you heard the statement of Fatima?\" `Aisha replied, \"It is not in her favor to mention.\" 'Urwa added, `Aisha reproached (Fatima) severely and said, \"Fatima was in a lonely place, and she was prone to danger, so the Prophet (ï·º) allowed her (to go out of her husband's house)",
