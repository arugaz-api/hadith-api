The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Allah knows that one of you two IS a liar; so will one of you repent?' But they refused. He then again said, 'Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?' But they refused, whereupon he separated them by divorce.\" Aiyub (a subnarrator) said: `Amr bin Dinar said to me, \"In the narration there is something which I do not see you mentioning, i.e. the husband said, \"What about my money (Mahr)?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You are not entitled to take back money, for if you told the truth you have already entered upon her (and consummated your marriage with her) and if you are a liar then you are less entitled to take it back","grades":[],"reference":{"book":68,"hadith":94}}}
