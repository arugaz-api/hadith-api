    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"A group of Israelites were lost. Nobody knows what they did. But I do not see them except that they were cursed and changed into rats, for if you put the milk of a she-camel in front of a rat, it will not drink it, but if the milk of a sheep is put in front of it, it will drink it.\" I told this to Ka`b who asked me, \"Did you hear it from the Prophet (ﷺ) ?\" I said, \"Yes.\" Ka`b asked me the same question several times.; I said to Ka`b. \"Do I read the Torah? (i.e. I tell you this from the Prophet)",
