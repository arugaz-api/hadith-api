    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:While we were in the company of the Prophet, he said, \"While I was asleep, I saw myself in Paradise and there I beheld a woman making ablution beside a palace, I asked, To whom does this palace belong? 'They said, To `Umar bin Al-Khattab.' Then I remembered `Umar's Ghaira (concerning women), and so I quickly went away from that palace.\" (When `Umar heard this from the Prophet), he wept and said, \"Do you think it is likely that I feel Ghaira because of you, O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)?",
