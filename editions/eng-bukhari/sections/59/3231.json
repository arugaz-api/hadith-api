So I departed, overwhelmed with excessive sorrow, and proceeded on, and could not relax till I found myself at Qarnath-Tha-alib where I lifted my head towards the sky to see a cloud shading me unexpectedly. I looked up and saw Gabriel in it.

The Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, \"O Muhammad! Order what you wish. If you like, I will let Al-Akh-Shabain (i.e. two mountains) fall on them.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"No but I hope that Allah will let them beget children who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship None besides Him",
