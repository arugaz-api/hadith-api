    "text": "Narrated Nafi`:`Abdullah (bin `Abdullah) bin `Umar said to his father, \"Stay here, for I am afraid that it (affliction between Ibn Zubair and Al-Hajjaj) might prevent you from reaching the Ka`ba.\" Ibn `Umar said, \"(In this case) I would do the same as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did, and Allah has said, 'Verily, in Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), you have a good example (to follow).' So, I make you, people, witness that I have made `Umra compulsory for me.\" So he assumed lhram for `Umra. Then he went out and when he reached Al- Baida', he assumed Ihram for Hajj and `Umra (together) and said, \"The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and `Umra are the same.\" He, then brought a Hadi from Qudaid. Then he arrived (at Mecca) and performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) once for both Hajj and `Umra and did not finish the lhram till he had finished both Hajj and `Umra",
