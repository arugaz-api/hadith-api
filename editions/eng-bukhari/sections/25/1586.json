Were your nation not close to the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka`ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham.\" That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka`ba. Jazz said, \"I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka`ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka`ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the northwest of the Ka`ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels.\" So Jarir asked Yazid, \"Where was the place of those stones?\" Jazz said, \"I will just now show it to you.\" So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, \"Here it is.\" Jarir said, \"It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so",
