The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa'da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma'da (ath-thamj and Sha'ban. The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked, \"Which month is this?\" We said, \"Allah and his Apostle know better.\" He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, \"Isn't it the month of Dhul-Hijja?\" We said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Which town is this?\" We said, \"Allah and His Apostle know better.\" He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, \"isn't it the town (of Mecca)?\" We replied, \"Yes.\" He said, \"What day is today?\" We replied, \"Allah and His Apostle know better.\" He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, \"Isn't it the day of Nahr?\" We replied, \"Yes.\" He then said, \"Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.\" (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, \"No doubt! Haven't I delivered (Allah's) Message (to you)? Haven't I delivered Allah's message (to you)?","grades":[],"reference":{"book":73,"hadith":6}}}
