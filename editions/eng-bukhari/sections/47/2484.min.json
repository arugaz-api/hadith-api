Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and then directed all the people to come with their utensils, and they started taking from it till all of them got what was sufficient for them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, \"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Messenger","grades":[],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":2}}}
