So Allah inspired to him \"At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you.\" Moses said, \"O my Lord! How can I meet him?\" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: \"Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey.\" Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, \"Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish.\" Moses remarked, \"That is what we have been seeking. So they went back retracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, \"How do people greet each other in your land?\" Moses said, \"I am Moses.\" He asked, \"The Moses of Bani Israel?\" Moses replied in the affirmative and added, \"May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught.\" Al-Khadir replied, \"Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know.\" Moses said, \"Allah willing, you will find me patient and I will disobey no order of yours.
