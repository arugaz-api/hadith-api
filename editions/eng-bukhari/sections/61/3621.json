    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:Musailama-al-Kadhdhab (i.e. the liar) came in the life-time of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with many of his people (to Medina) and said, \"If Muhammad makes me his successor, I will follow him.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went up to him with Thabit bin Qais bin Shams; and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was carrying a piece of a datepalm leaf in his hand. He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, \"If you asked me even this piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.\" Abu Huraira told me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); said, \"While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama",
