    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The delegates of `Abd-ul-Qais came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We are from the tribe of Rabi`a and the infidels of Mudar tribe stand between us and you, so that we cannot come to you except in the Sacred Months. Therefore we would like you to give us some instructions which we may follow and convey to our people staying behind us.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I order you to observe four things and forbid you (to do) four things: (I order you) to believe in Allah testifying that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah; to offer the prayer perfectly; to pay the Zakat; and to give one-fifth of the war booty to Allah. And I forbid you to use Ad-Dubba, Al-Hantam, An-Naqir and Al- Muzaffat.\" (These are names of utensils in which alcoholic drinks were served)",
