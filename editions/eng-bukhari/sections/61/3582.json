    "text": "Narrated Anas:Once during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), the people of Medina suffered from drought. So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a man got up saying, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you invoke Allah to bless us with rain?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) lifted both his hands and invoked. The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.\" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) smiled and said, \"O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.\" I then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina",
