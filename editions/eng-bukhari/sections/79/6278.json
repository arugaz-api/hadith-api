    "text": "Narrated Ibrahim:'Alaqama went to Sham and came to the mosque and offered a two-rak`at prayer, and invoked Allah: \"O Allah! Bless me with a (pious) good companion.\" So he sat beside Abu Ad-Darda' who asked, \"From where are you?\" He said, \"From the people of Kufa.\" Abu Darda' said, \"Wasn't there among you the person who keeps the secrets (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) which nobody knew except him (i.e., Hudhaifa (bin Al-Yaman)). And isn't there among you the person whom Allah gave refuge from Satan through the request (tongue) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? (i.e., `Ammar). Isn't there among you the one who used to carry the Siwak and the cushion (or pillows (of the Prophets)? (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud). How did Ibn Mas`ud use to recite 'By the night as it conceals (the light)?\" (Sura 92). 'Alqama said, \"Wadhdhakari Wal Untha' (And by male and female.\") Abu Ad-Darda added. 'These people continued to argue with me regarding it till they were about to cause me to have doubts although I heard it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)",
