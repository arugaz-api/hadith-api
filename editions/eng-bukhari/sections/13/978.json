    "text": "Narrated Ibn Juraij:`Ata' told me that he had heard Jabir bin `Abdullah saying, \"The Prophet (ï·º) stood up to offer the prayer of the `Id ul Fitr. He first offered the prayer and then delivered the Khutba. After finishing it he got down (from the pulpit) and went towards the women and advised them while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was spreading out his garment where the women were putting their alms.\" I asked `Ata' whether it was the Zakat of `Id ul Fitr. He said, \"No, it was just alms given at that time. Some lady put her finger ring and the others would do the same.\" I said, (to `Ata'), \"Do you think that it is incumbent upon the Imam to give advice to the women (on `Id day)?\" He said, \"No doubt, it is incumbent upon the Imams to do so and why should they not do so?",
