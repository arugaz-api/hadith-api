    "text": "Narrated Anas:The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the `Id prayer, should slaughter again.\" A man stood up and said, \"This is the day on which one has desire for meat,\" and he mentioned something about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet (ﷺ) I believed him. Then the same man added, \"I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or for others as well",
