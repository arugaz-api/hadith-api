So his family slaughtered (the animal ) before the prayer. Then they mentioned that event to the Prophet who ordered Al-Bara to slaughter another sacrifice. Al-Bara' said to the Prophet (ï·º) , \"I have a young milch she-goat which is better than two sheep for slaughtering.\" (The sub-narrator, Ibn 'Aun used to say, \"I don't know whether the permission (to slaughter a she-goat as a sacrifice) was especially given to Al-Bara' or if it was in general for all the Muslims.\") (See Hadith No. 99, Vol)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":83,"hadith":51}}}
