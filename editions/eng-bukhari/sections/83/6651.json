Consequently, the people had similar rings made for themselves. Afterwards the Prophet; sat on the pulpit and took it off, saying, \"I used to wear this ring and keep its stone towards the palm of my hand.\" He then threw it away and said, \"By Allah, I will never wear it.\" Therefore all the people threw away their rings as well",
