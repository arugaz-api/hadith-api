So when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw him, he said (to him), \"If I had been sure that you were looking at me (through the door), I would have poked your eye with this (sharp iron bar).\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) added, \"The asking for permission to enter has been enjoined so that one may not look unlawfully (at what there is in the house without the permission of its people)",
