I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah's Apostle. (The narrator confirms that he sent two thighs). The Prophet (ï·º) accepted that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas, \"Did the Prophet; eat from it?\" Anas replied, \"He ate from it)",
