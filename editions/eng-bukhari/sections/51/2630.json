The Ansar gave them their land on condition that the emigrants would give them half the yearly yield and work on the land and provide the necessaries for cultivation.\" His (i.e. Anas's mother who was also the mother of `Abdullah bin Abu Talha, gave some date-palms to Allah' Apostle who gave them to his freed slave-girl (Um Aiman) who was also the mother of Usama bin Zaid. When the Prophet (ﷺ) finished from the fighting against the people of Khaibar and returned to Medina, the emigrants returned to the Ansar the fruit gifts which the Ansar had given them. The Prophet (ﷺ) also returned to Anas's mother the date-palms. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave Um Aiman other trees from his garden in lieu of the old gift",
