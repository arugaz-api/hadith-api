    "text": "Narrated Abu Sa`id:A bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him about emigration. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, \"May Allah be merciful to you. The matter of emigration is difficult. Have you got some camels?\" He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, \"Do you pay their Zakat?\" He replied in the affirmative. He asked, \"Do you lend them so that their milk may be utilized by others?\" The bedouin said, \"Yes.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, \"Do you milk them on the day off watering them?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Do good deeds beyond the merchants (or the sea) and Allah will never disregard any of your deeds.\" (See Hadith No. 260, Vol)",
