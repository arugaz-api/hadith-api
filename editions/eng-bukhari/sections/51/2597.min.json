When he returned he said, \"This (i.e. the Zakat) is for you and this has been given to my as a present.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Why hadn't he stayed in his father's or mother's house to see whether he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a sheep, it will be bleating.\" The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, \"O Allah! Haven't I conveyed Your Message (to them)?","grades":[],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":31}}}
