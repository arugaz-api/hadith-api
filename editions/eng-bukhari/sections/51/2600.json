    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:A man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"I am ruined.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, \"What do you mean?\" He said, \"I had a sexual intercourse with my wife during Ramadan (while fasting).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, \"Can you manumit a slave?\" He replied in the negative. He then asked him, \"Can you fast for two successive months continuously\" He replied in the negative. The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked him, \"Can you feed sixty poor persons?\" He replied in the negative. In the meantime an Ansari came with a basket full of dates. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to the man, \"Take it and give it in charity (as an expiation of your sin).\" The man said \"Should I give it to some people who are poorer than we O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, there is no family between Medina's two mountains poorer than we.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told him to take it and provide his family with it",
