The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and addressed them, \"O Assembly of Jews! Embrace Islam and you will be safe!\" The Jews replied, \"O Aba-l-Qasim! You have conveyed Allah's message to us.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"That is what I want (from you).\" He repeated his first statement for the second time, and they said, \"You have conveyed Allah's message, O Aba-l- Qasim.\" Then he said it for the third time and added, \"You should Know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I want to exile you fro,,, this land, so whoever among you owns some property, can sell it, otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle.\" (See Hadith No. 392, Vol)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":89,"hadith":5}}}
