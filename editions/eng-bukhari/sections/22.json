They then told me to go to Um Salama with the same question with which t sent me to `Aisha. Um Salama replied, \"I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after he prayed the `Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, 'Stand beside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have heard you forbidding the offering of these (two rak`at after the `Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them.\" If he waves his hand then wait for him.' The slave girl did that. The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned her with his hand and she waited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, \"O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked me about the two rak`at after the `Asr prayer. The people of the tribe of `Abdul-Qais came to me and made me busy and I could not offer the two rak`at after the Zuhr prayer. These (two rak`at that I have just prayed) are for those (missed) ones",

So will you lead the people in prayer?\" Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, if you wish.\" Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr, went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the meantime Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never glance sideways in his prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and (ﷺ) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, \"O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, 'Subhan-Allah' for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned you to do so?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"How dare the son of Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?",
