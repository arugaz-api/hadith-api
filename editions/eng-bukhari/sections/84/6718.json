The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on.\" We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others, \"Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asking him for mounts, and although he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us.\" So we returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him.

By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration",
