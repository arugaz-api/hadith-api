When the document of treaty was written, the following was mentioned: 'These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) agreed (to make peace).' They said, \"We will not agree to this, for if we believed that you are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin `Abdullah.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and also Muhammad bin `Abdullah.\" Then he said to `Ali, \"Rub off (the words) 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)' \", but `Ali said, \"No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name.\" So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took the document and wrote, 'This is what Muhammad bin `Abdullah has agreed upon: No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to stay.'

The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions), calling, \"O Uncle! O Uncle!\" `Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, \"Take your uncle's daughter.\" Zaid and Ja`far quarreled about her. `Ali said, \"I have more right to her as she is my uncle's daughter.\" Ja`far said, \"She is my uncle's daughter, and her aunt is my wife.\" Zaid said, \"She is my brother's daughter.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to 'All, \"You are from me and I am from you\", and said to Ja`far, \"You resemble me both in character and appearance\", and said to Zaid, \"You are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave",
