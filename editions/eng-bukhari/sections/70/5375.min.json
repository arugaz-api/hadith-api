He entered his house and interpreted it to me. (Then I went out and) after walking for a short distance, I fell on my face because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw Allah's Apostle standing by my head. He said, \"O Abu Huraira!\" I replied, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ï·º), and Sadaik!\" Then he held me by the hand, and made me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He took me to his house, and ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drank thereof and he said, \"Drink more, O Abu Hirr!\" So I drank again, whereupon he again said, \"Drink more.\" So I drank more till my belly became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met 'Umar and mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, \"Somebody, who had more right than you, O 'Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I asked you to recite a Verse to me while I knew it better than you.\" On that Umar said to me, \"By Allah, if I admitted and entertained you, it would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels","grades":[],"reference":{"book":70,"hadith":3}}}
