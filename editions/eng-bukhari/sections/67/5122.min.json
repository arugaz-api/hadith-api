I went to `Uthman bin `Affan and presented Hafsa (for marriage) to him. He said, \"I will think it over.' I waited for a few days, then he met me and said, 'It seems that it is not possible for me to marry at present.' \" `Umar further said, \"I met Abu Bakr As-Siddique and said to him, 'If you wish, I will marry my daughter Hafsa to you.\" Abu Bakr kept quiet and did not say anything to me in reply. I became more angry with him than with `Uthman. I waited for a few days and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him. Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said, 'Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?' I said, 'Yes.' Abu Bakr said, 'Nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allah's Apostle had mentioned her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And if Allah's Apostle had refused her, I would have accepted her","grades":[],"reference":{"book":67,"hadith":58}}}
