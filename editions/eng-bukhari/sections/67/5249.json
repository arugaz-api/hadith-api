    "text": "Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin `Abis:I heard Ibn `Abbas answering a man who asked him, \"Did you attend the prayer of `Id al Adha or `Idal- Fitr with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" Ibn `Abbas replied, \"Yes, and had it not been for my close relationship with him, I could not have offered it.\" (That was because of his young age). Ibn `Abbas further said, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out and offered the Id prayer and then delivered the sermon.\" Ibn `Abbas did not mention anything about the Adhan (the call for prayer) or the Iqama. He added, \"Then the Prophet (ﷺ) went to the women and instructed them and gave them religious advice and ordered them to give alms and I saw them reaching out (their hands to) their ears and necks (to take off the earrings and necklaces, etc.) and throwing (it) towards Bilal. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) returned with Bilal to his house",
