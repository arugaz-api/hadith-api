    "text": "Narrated Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) I bought a cushion having on it pictures (of animals). When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I repent to Allah and His Apostle. What sin have I committed?' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said. \"What is this cushion?\" I said, \"I have bought it for you so that you may sit on it and recline on it.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"The makers of these pictures will be punished on the Day of Resurrection, and it will be said to them, 'Give life to what you have created (i.e., these pictures).' \" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"The Angels of (Mercy) do not enter a house in which there are pictures (of animals)",
