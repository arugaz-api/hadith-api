    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:My foster uncle came and asked permission (to enter) but I refused to admit him till I asked Allah's Apostle about that. He said, \"He is your uncle, so allow him to come in.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have been suckled by a woman and not by a man.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"He is your uncle, so let him enter upon you.\" And that happened after the order of Al-Hijab (compulsory veiling) was revealed. All things which become unlawful because of blood relations are unlawful because of the corresponding foster suckling relations",
