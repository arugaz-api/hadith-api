When he came to demand it back, the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to some people), \"Give him (his due).\" When the people searched for a camel of that age, they found none, but found a camel one year older. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Give (it to) him.\" On that, the man remarked, \"You have given me my right in full.
