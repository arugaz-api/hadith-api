Not to be disobedient (when ordered) to do good deed.\" The Prophet (ï·º) added: \"Whoever among you fulfills his pledge will be rewarded by Allah. And whoever indulges in any one of them (except the ascription of partners to Allah) and gets the punishment in this world, that punishment will be an expiation for that sin. And if one indulges in any of them, and Allah conceals his sin, it is up to Him to forgive or punish him (in the Hereafter).\" 'Ubada bin As-Samit added: \"So we swore allegiance for these.\" (points to Allah's Apostle)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":11}}}
