Where will you stay tomorrow?\" He said, \"Has `Aqil left for us any house?\" He then added, \"Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e. Al-Muhassab, where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal to heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against Bani Hashim on the terms that they would not deal with the members of the is tribe or give them shelter.\" (Az-Zuhri said, \"Khaif means valley.\") (See Hadith No. 659, Vol)",
