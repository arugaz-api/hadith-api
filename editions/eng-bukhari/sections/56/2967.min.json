{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":2967,"arabicnumber":2967,"text":"Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:I participated in a Ghazwa along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) The Prophet (ﷺ) met me (on the way) while I was riding a camel of ours used for irrigation and it had got so tired that it could hardly walk. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked me, \"What is wrong with the camel?\" I replied, \"It has got tired.\" So. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came from behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it so it started surpassing the other camels and going ahead of them. Then he asked me, \"How do you find your camel (now)?\" I replied, \"I find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings.\" He said, \"Will you sell it to me?\" I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it was the only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Sell it to me then.\" I sold it to him on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I reached Medina. Then I said, \"O Allah's Apostle! I am a bridegroom,\" and requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and I informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had married a matron. He said, \"Why hadn't you married a virgin who would have played with you, and you would have played with her?\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that I should marry a young girl like them who would neither teach them manners nor serve them. So, I have married a matron so that she may serve them and teach them manners.\" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next morning and he gave me its price and gave me the camel itself as well","grades":[],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":176}}}
