    "text": "Narrated Yali:I participated in the Ghazwa of Tabuk along with Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and I gave a young camel to be ridden in Jihad and that was, to me, one of my best deeds. Then I employed a laborer who quarrelled with another person. One of them bit the hand of the other and the latter drew his hand from the mouth of the former pulling out his front tooth. Then the former instituted a suit against the latter before the Prophet who rejected that suit saying, \"Do you expect him to put out his hand for you to snap as a male camel snaps (vegetation)?",
