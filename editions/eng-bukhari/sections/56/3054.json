Buy this cloak and adorn yourself with it on the `Id festivals and on meeting the delegations.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"This is the dress for the one who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter).\" After sometime had passed, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent a silken cloak to `Umar. `Umar took it and brought it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You have said that this is the dress of that who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter), yet you have sent me this!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said,\" I have sent it) so that you may sell it or fulfill with it some of your needs",
