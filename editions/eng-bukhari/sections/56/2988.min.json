He opened the door of the Ka`ba and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered in the company of Usama, Bilal and `Uthman, and stayed in it for a long period. When he came out, the people rushed to it, and `Abdullah bin `Umar was the first to enter it and found Bilal standing behind the door. He asked Bilal, \"Where did the Prophet (ﷺ) offer his prayer?\" He pointed to the place where he had offered his prayer. `Abdullah said, \"I forgot to ask him how many rak`at he had performed","grades":[],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":197}}}
