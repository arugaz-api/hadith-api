    "text": "Narrated Jabir:My father's mutilated body was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) and was placed in front of him. I went to uncover his face but my companions forbade me. Then mourning cries of a lady were heard, and it was said that she was either the daughter or the sister of `Amr. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Why is she crying?\" Or said, \"Do not cry, for the angels are still shading him with their wings.\" (Al-Bukhari asked Sadqa, a sub-narrator, \"Does the narration include the expression: 'Till he was lifted?' \" The latter replied, \"Jabir may have said it)",
