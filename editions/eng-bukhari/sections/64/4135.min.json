The time of the afternoon nap overtook them when they were in a valley full of thorny trees. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) dismounted and the people dispersed amongst the thorny trees, seeking the shade of the trees. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took shelter under a Samura tree and hung his sword on it. We slept for a while when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) suddenly called us, and we went to him, to find a bedouin sitting with him. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"This (bedouin) took my sword out of its sheath while I was asleep. When I woke up, the naked sword was in his hand and he said to me, 'Who can save you from me?, I replied, 'Allah.' Now here he is sitting.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not punish him (for that)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":179}}}
