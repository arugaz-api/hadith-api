So, Abu 'Ubaida arrived with the money from Bahrain. When the Ansar heard of the arrival of Abu 'Ubaida (on the next day) they offered the morning prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) and when the morning prayer had finished, they presented themselves before him. On seeing the Ansar, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said, \"I think you have heard that Abu 'Ubaida has brought something?\" They replied, \"Indeed, it is so, O Allah's Apostle!\" He said, \"Be happy, and hope for what will please you. By Allah, I am not afraid that you will be poor, but I fear that worldly wealth will be bestowed upon you as it was bestowed upon those who lived before you. So you will compete amongst yourselves for it, as they competed for it and it will destroy you as it did them","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":65}}}
