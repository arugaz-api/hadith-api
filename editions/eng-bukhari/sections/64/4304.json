    "text": "Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:A lady committed theft during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the Ghazwa of Al-Fath, ((i.e. Conquest of Mecca). Her folk went to Usama bin Zaid to intercede for her (with the Prophet). When Usama interceded for her with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), the color of the face of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) changed and he said, \"Do you intercede with me in a matter involving one of the legal punishments prescribed by Allah?\" Usama said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Ask Allah's Forgiveness for me.\" So in the afternoon, Allah's Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He deserved and then said, \"Amma ba'du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would apply (Allah's) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad's soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut her hand.\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off. Afterwards her repentance proved sincere and she got married. `Aisha said, \"That lady used to visit me and I used to convey her demands to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)",
