A bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"Won't you fulfill what you have promised me?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Rejoice (at what I will do for you).' The bedouin said, \"(You have said to me) rejoice too often.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) turned to me (i.e. Abu Musa) and Bilal in an angry mood and said, 'The bedouin has refused the good tidings, so you both accept them.' Bilal and I said, 'We accept them.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked for a drinking bowl containing water and washed his hands and face in it, and then took a mouthful of water and threw it therein saying (to us), \"Drink (some of) it and pour (some) over your faces and chests and be happy at the good tidings.\" So they both took the drinking bowl and did as instructed. Um Salama called from behind a screen, \"Keep something (of the water for your mother.\" So they left some of it for her)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":357}}}
