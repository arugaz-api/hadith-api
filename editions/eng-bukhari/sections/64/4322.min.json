{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4322,"arabicnumber":4322,"text":"Narrated Abu Qatada:When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a Muslim man fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself behind the Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan who was hiding behind the Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off. That man got hold of me and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then he knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. The Muslims (excepting the Prophet (ﷺ) and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with them. Suddenly I met `Umar bin Al-Khattab amongst the people and I asked him, \"What is wrong with the people?\" He said, \"It is the order of Allah\" Then the people returned to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (after defeating the enemy). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the killed man.\" So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). A man from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, \"The arms of the deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate him for it (i.e. the spoils),\" Abu Bakr said, \"No, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) will not give it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Allah's Lions who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then got up and gave that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got after embracing Islam","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":352}}}
