    "text": "Narrated Sa`d bin Ibrahim:A meal was brought to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf while he was fasting. He said, \"Mus`ab bin `Umar was martyred, and he was better than I, yet he was shrouded in a Burda (i.e. a sheet) so that, if his head was covered, his feet became naked, and if his feet were covered, his head became naked.\" `Abdur-Rahman added, \"Hamza was martyred and he was better than 1. Then worldly wealth was bestowed upon us and we were given thereof too much. We are afraid that the reward of our deeds have been given to us in this life.\" `Abdur-Rahman then started weeping so much that he left the food",
