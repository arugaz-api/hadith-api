But the revenue of Al-Bahrain did not come till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had died. When the revenue came during the rule of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr ordered an announcer to announce, \"Whoever had any debt or promise due upon the Prophet, should present himself to me (i.e. Abu Bakr). I came to Abu Bakr and informed him that the Prophet (ﷺ) had said (to me), \"If the revenue of Al-Bahrain should come, I will give you so-much and so much,\" repeating \"so much\" thrice. So Abu Bakr gave me (in another narration Jaibir said,). I met Abu Bakr after that and asked him (to give me what the Prophet (ﷺ) had promised me) but he did not give me. I again went to him but he did not give me. I again went to him (for the third time) but he did not give me; On that I said to him, \"I came to you but you did not give me, then I came to you and you did not give me, and then again I came to you, but you did not give me; so you should either give me or else you are like a miserly to me, on that, Abu Bakr said, \"Do you say, 'You are like a miserly to me?' There is no worse disease than miserliness.\" Abu Bakr said it thrice and added, \"Whenever I refused to give you, I had the intention of giving you.\" (In another narration) Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"I went to Abu Bakr (and he gave me a handful of money) and told me to count it, I counted and found it five-hundred, and then Abu Bakr said (to me), \"Take the same amount twice",
