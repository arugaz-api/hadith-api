    "text": "Narrated `Amra:I heard `Aisha saying, \"When the news of the martyrdom of Ibn Haritha, Ja`far bin Abi Talib and `Abdullah bin Rawaka reached, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat with sorrow explicit on his face.\" `Aisha added, \"I was then peeping through a chink in the door. A man came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The women of Ja`far are crying.' Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) told him to forbid them to do so. So the man went away and returned saying, \"I forbade them but they did not listen to me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered him again to go (and forbid them). He went again and came saying, 'By Allah, they overpowered me (i.e. did not listen to me).\" `Aisha said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to him), \"Go and throw dust into their mouths.\" Aisha added, \"I said, May Allah put your nose in the dust! By Allah, neither have you done what you have been ordered, nor have you relieved Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from trouble",
