He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes the state of Ihram for `Umra wearing a cloak after applying perfume to his body?\" `Umar signalled with his hand to Ya`la to come (near). Ya`la came and put his head (underneath that cloth sheet) and saw the Prophet (ﷺ) red-faced and when that state (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) was over, he said, \"Where is he who as already asked me about the `Umra?\" The man was looked for and brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), \"As for the perfume you have applied to your body, wash it off your body) thrice, and take off your cloak, and then do in your `Umra the rites you do in your Hajj",
