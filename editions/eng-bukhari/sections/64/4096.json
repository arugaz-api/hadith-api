    "text": "Narrated `Asim Al-Ahwal:I asked Anas bin Malik regarding Al-Qunut during the prayer. Anas replied, \"Yes (Al-Qunut was said by the Prophet (ﷺ) in the prayer).\" I said, \"Is it before Bowing or after Bowing?\" Anas replied, \"(It was said) before (Bowing).\" I said, \"So-and-so informed me that you told him that it was said after Bowing.\" Anas replied, \"He was mistaken, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said Al-Qunut after Bowing for one month. The Prophet (ﷺ) had sent some people called Al-Qurra who were seventy in number, to some pagan people who had concluded a peace treaty with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . But those who had concluded the treaty with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) violated the treaty (and martyred all the seventy men). So Allah's Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing (in the prayer) for one month, invoking evil upon them",
