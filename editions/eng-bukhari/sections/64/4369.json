    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The delegation of `Abdul Qais came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) We belong to the tribe of Rabi`a. The infidels of Mudar tribe intervened between us and you so that we cannot come to you except in the Sacred Months, so please order us some things we may act on and invite those left behind to act on. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I order you to observe four things and forbid you from four things: (I order you) to believe in Allah, i.e. to testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) pointed with finger indicating one and added, \"To offer prayers perfectly: to give Zakat, and to give one-fifth of the booty you win (for Allah's Sake). I forbid you to use Ad-Dubba', An-Naquir, Al-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat, (Utensils used for preparing alcoholic liquors and drinks)",
