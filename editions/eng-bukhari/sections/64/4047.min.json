If we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said to us, \"Cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet or throw Idhkhir over his feet.\" But some amongst us have got the fruits of their labor ripened, and they are collecting them","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":93}}}
