Can these young fellows recite Qur'an as you do?\" Ibn Mas`ud said, \"If you wish I can order one of them to recite (Qur'an) for you .\" Khabbab replied, \"Yes. \"Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Recite, O 'Alqama!\" On that, Zaid bin Hudair, the brother of Ziyad bin Hudair said, (to Ibn Mas`ud), \"Why have you ordered 'Alqama to recite though he does not recite better than we?\" Ibn Mas`ud said, \"If you like, I would tell you what the Prophet (ï·º) said about your nation and his (i.e. 'Alqama's) nation.\" So I recited fifty Verses from Sura-Maryam. `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud) said to Khabbab, \"What do you think (about 'Alqama's recitation)?\" Khabbab said, \"He has recited well.\" `Abdullah said, \"Whatever I recite, 'Alqama recites.\" Then `Abdullah turned towards Khabbab and saw that he was wearing a gold ring, whereupon he said, \"Hasn't the time for its throwing away come yet?\" Khabbab said, \"You will not see me wearing it after today,\" and he throw it away",
