She added, \"But he said now they know very well what I used to tell them was the truth.\" `Aisha then recited: 'You cannot make the dead hear.' (30.52) and 'You cannot make those who are in their Graves, hear you.' (35.22) that is, when they had taken their places in the (Hell) Fire","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":31}}}
