He had combed it and it was dripping water; and he was performing the Tawaf around the Ka`ba leaning on two men or on the shoulders of two men. l asked, \"Who is this?\" It was said. \"Messiah, the son of Mary.\" Suddenly I saw a curly-haired man, blind in the right eye which looked like a protruding out grape.
