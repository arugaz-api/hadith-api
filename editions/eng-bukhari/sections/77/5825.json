    "text": "Narrated `Ikrima:Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, `Aisha said, \"I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!\" When `AbdurRahman heard that his wife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, \"By Allah! I have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this,\" holding and showing the fringe of her garment, `Abdur-Rahman said, \"By Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She has told a lie! I am very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa`a.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, to her, \"If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa`a unless `Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) saw two boys with `Abdur- Rahman and asked (him), \"Are these your sons?\" On that `AbdurRahman said, \"Yes.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You claim what you claim (i.e.. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crow",
