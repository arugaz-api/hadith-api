He ordered us to do seven other things. To pay a visit to the sick; to follow funeral processions; to say, \"May Allah be merciful to you\" to a sneezer if he says \"Praise be to Allah\"; to return greetings, to accept invitations; to help others to fulfil their oaths and to help the oppressed ones",
