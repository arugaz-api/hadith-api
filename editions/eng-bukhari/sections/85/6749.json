    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:`Utba (bin Abi Waqqas) said to his brother Sa`d, \"The son of the slave girl of Zam`a is my son, so be his custodian.\" So when it was the year of the Conquest of Mecca, Sa`d took that child and said, \"He is my nephew, and my brother told me to be his custodian.\" On that, 'Abu bin Zam`a got up and said, 'but the child is my brother, and the son of my father's slave girl as he was born on his bed.\" So they both went to the Prophet. Sa`d said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (This is) the son of my brother and he told me to be his custodian.\" Then 'Abu bin Zam`a said, \"(But he is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, born on his bed.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This child is for you. O 'Abu bin Zam`a, as the child is for the owner of the bed, and the adulterer receives the stones.\" He then ordered (his wife) Sauda bint Zam`a to cover herself before that boy as he noticed the boy's resemblance to `Utba. Since then the boy had never seen Sauda till he died",
