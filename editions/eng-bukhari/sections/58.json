Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had established peace with the people of Bahrain and appointed Al-`Ala' bin Al-Hadrami as their governor. When Abu 'Ubaida came from Bahrain with the money, the Ansar heard of Abu 'Ubaida's arrival which coincided with the time of the morning prayer with the Prophet. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) led them in the morning prayer and finished, the Ansar approached him, and he looked at them and smiled on seeing them and said, \"I feel that you have heard that Abu. 'Ubaida has brought something?\" They said, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)' He said, \"Rejoice and hope for what will please you! By Allah, I am not afraid of your poverty but I am afraid that you will lead a life of luxury as past nations did, whereupon you will compete with each other for it, as they competed for it, and it will destroy you as it destroyed them",

When Al-Hurmuzan embraced Islam, `Umar said to him. \"I would like to consult you regarding these countries which I intend to invade.\" Al-Hurmuzan said, \"Yes, the example of these countries and their inhabitants who are the enemies. of the Muslims, is like a bird with a head, two wings and two legs; If one of its wings got broken, it would get up over its two legs, with one wing and the head; and if the other wing got broken, it would get up with two legs and a head, but if its head got destroyed, then the two legs, two wings and the head would become useless. The head stands for Khosrau, and one wing stands for Caesar and the other wing stands for Faris. So, order the Muslims to go towards Khosrau.\" So, `Umar sent us (to Khosrau) appointing An-Nu`man bin Muqrin as our commander. When we reached the land of the enemy, the representative of Khosrau came out with forty-thousand warriors, and an interpreter got up saying, \"Let one of you talk to me!\" Al-Mughira replied, \"Ask whatever you wish.\" The other asked, \"Who are you?\" Al-Mughira replied, \"We are some people from the Arabs; we led a hard, miserable, disastrous life: we used to suck the hides and the date stones from hunger; we used to wear clothes made up of fur of camels and hair of goats, and to worship trees and stones. While we were in this state, the Lord of the Heavens and the Earths, Elevated is His Remembrance and Majestic is His Highness, sent to us from among ourselves a Prophet whose father and mother are known to us. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord, has ordered us to fight you till you worship Allah Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and our Prophet has informed us that our Lord says:-- \"Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e. martyred), shall go to Paradise to lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become your master.\" (Al-Mughira, then blamed An-Nu`man for delaying the attack and) An-Nu' man said to Al-Mughira, \"If you had participated in a similar battle, in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he would not have blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced you. But I accompanied Allah's Apostle in many battles and it was his custom that if he did not fight early by daytime, he would wait till the wind had started blowing and the time for the prayer was due (i.e. after midday)",

We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of Hudaibiya, and if we had been called to fight, we would have fought. But `Umar bin Al Khatab came and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Aren't we in the right and our opponents in the wrongs' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Yes.' `Umar said, 'Aren't our killed persons in Paradise and their's in Hell?' He said, 'Yes.' `Umar said, 'Then why should we accept hard terms in matters concerning our religion? Shall we return before Allah judges between us and them?' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'O Ibn Al- Khattab! I am the Messenger of Allah and Allah will never degrade me. Then `Umar went to Abu Bakr and told him the same as he had told the Prophet. On that Abu Bakr said (to `Umar). 'He is the Messenger of Allah and Allah will never degrade him.' Then Surat-al-Fath (i.e. Victory) was revealed and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited it to the end in front of `Umar. On that `Umar asked, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Was it (i.e. the Hudaibiya Treaty) a victory?' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Yes",

They stipulated that he would not stay for more than three days and would not enter it except with sheathed arms and would not preach (Islam) to any of them. So `Ali bin Abi- Talib started writing the treaty between them. He wrote, \"This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has agreed to.\" The (Meccans) said, \"If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the Messenger of Allah, then we would not have prevented you and would have followed you. But write, 'This is what Muhammad bin `Abdullah has agreed to..' \" On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"By Allah, I am Muhammad bin `Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of 'Allah.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used not to write; so he asked `Ali to erase the expression of Apostle of Allah. On that `Ali said, \"By Allah I will never erase it.\" Allah's Apostle said (to `Ali), \"Let me see the paper.\" When `Ali showed him the paper, the Prophet (ﷺ) erased the expression with his own hand. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had entered Mecca and three days had elapsed, the Meccans came to `Ali and said, \"Let your friend (i.e. the Prophet) quit Mecca.\" `Ali informed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Yes,\" and then he departed",
