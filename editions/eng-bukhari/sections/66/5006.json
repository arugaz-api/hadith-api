I was praying.\" He said, \"Didn't Allah say: 'O you who believe! Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle when he calls you'?\" (8.24) He then said, \"Shall I not teach you the most superior Surah in the Qur'an?\" He said, '(It is), 'Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
