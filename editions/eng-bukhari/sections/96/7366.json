Some of them said, \"Come near so that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray,\" while some of them said what `Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, \"Go away and leave me.\" Ibn `Abbas used to say, \"It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from writing that writing for them",
