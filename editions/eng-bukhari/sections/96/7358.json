    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:Um Hufaid bint Al-Harith bin Hazn presented the Prophet (ﷺ) with some butter, dried yoghurt (curd milk) and mastigures as a gift. The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked for a meal (mastigures etc. to be put) and it was eaten over his table cloth, but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not eat of it, as he had aversion to it. But if it had been illegal to eat, it would not have been eaten over his table cloth nor would he have ordered that (mastigures meat) to be eaten",
