Men (only) benefit by your teachings, so please devote to us from (some of) your time, a day on which we may come to you so that you may teach us of what Allah has taught you.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Gather on such-and-such a day at suchand- such a place.\" They gathered and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to them and taught them of what Allah had taught him. He then said, \"No woman among you who has lost her three children (died) but that they will screen her from the Fire.\" A woman among them said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If she lost two children?\" She repeated her question twice, whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Even two, even two, even two!\" (See Hadith No. 341, Vol)",
