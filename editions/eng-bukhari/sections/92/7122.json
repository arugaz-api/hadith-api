    "text": "Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba:Nobody asked the Prophet (ﷺ) as many questions as I asked regarding Ad-Dajjal. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, \"What worries you about him?\" I said, \"Because the people say that he will have a mountain of bread and a river of water with him (i.e. he will have abundance of food and water)\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Nay, he is too mean to be allowed such a thing by Allah\"' (but it is only to test mankind whether they believe in Allah or in Ad-Dajjal)",
