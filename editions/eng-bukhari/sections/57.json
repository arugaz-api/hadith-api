When I intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle, I had an appointment with a goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa' to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party. I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two shecamels were kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I collected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, \"Who has done this?\" The people replied, \"Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari drunks in this house.\" I went away till I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and Zaid bin Haritha was with him. The Prophet (ﷺ) noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet (ﷺ) asked. \"What is wrong with you.\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in the company of some drunks.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. Hamza looked at Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. Hamza then said, \"Aren't you but the slaves of my father?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) realized that he was drunk, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) retreated, and we went out with him",

Abu Bakr said to her, \"Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).\" Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and said, \"I will not leave anything Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the Prophet's tradition, then I would go astray.\" (Later on) `Umar gave the Prophet's property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to `Ali and `Abbas, but he withheld the properties of Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, \"These two properties are the Sadaqa which Allah's Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is to be entrusted to the ruler.\" (Az-Zuhri said, \"They have been managed in this way till today)",

        "text": "Narrated Malik bin Aus:While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of `Umar bin Al- Khattab came to me and said, \"The chief of the believers has sent for you.\" So, I went along with him till I entered the place where `Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, \"O Mali! Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.\" I said, \"O chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it.\" He said, \"O man! Take it.\" While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa' came saying, \"`Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Az-Zubair and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas are asking your permission (to see you); may I admit them?\" `Umar said, \"Yes\", So they were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa' came again and said, \"May I admit `Ali and `Abbas?\" `Umar said, \"yes.\" So, they were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then `Abbas said, \"O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. `Ali).\" They had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The group (i.e. `Uthman and his companions) said, \"O chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them front each other.\" `Umar said, \"Be patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our (i.e. prophets') property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),' and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) meant himself (by saying \"we'')?\" The group said, \"He said so.\" `Umar then turned to `Ali and `Abbas and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, do you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said so?\" They replied, \" He said so.\" `Umar then said, \"So, I will talk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else.\" `Umar then recited the Holy Verses: \"What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them --- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power to His Apostles over whomever He will 'And Allah is able to do all things.\" 9:6) `Umar added \"So this property was especially given to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue to be spent on Allah 's Cause. Allah 's Apostle kept on doing this during all his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?\" They replies in the affirmative. `Umar then said to `Ali and `Abbas. \"I ask you by Allah, do you know this?\" `Umar added, \"When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, 'Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and rightlyguided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr's successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. 'Ah and `Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, `Abbas, came to me asking for your share from your nephew's property, and this man, i.e. `Ali, came to me asking for his wife's share from her father's property. I told you both that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our (prophets') properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).' When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I said to you, 'I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Allah's Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in charge of it.' So, both of you said (to me), 'Hand it over to us,' and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this condition?\" The group aid, \"Yes.\" Then `Umar faced `Ali and `Abbas saying, \"I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?\" They said, \"Yes. \" He said, \" Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf",

So, the prophet carried out the expedition and when he reached that town at the time or nearly at the time of the `Asr prayer, he said to the sun, 'O sun! You are under Allah's Order and I am under Allah's Order O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.' It was stopped till Allah made him victorious. Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it did not burn it. He said (to his men), 'Some of you have stolen something from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck over the hand of their prophet. Then that prophet said (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by your people. So all the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said, \"You have committed the theft.' Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty.

Today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will be something left for us from our money?\" Az-Zubair added, \"O my son! Sell our property and pay my debts.\" Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, `Abdullah's sons. He said, \"One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.\" (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, \"Some of the sons of `Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and `Abbas. `Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time.\" (The narrator `Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my attention to his debts saying, \"If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you.\" By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I asked, \"O father! Who is your Master?\" He replied, \"Allah (is my Master).\" By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, \"Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf .\" and Allah would (help me to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az-Zubair would say, \"No, (i won't keep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.\" Az-Zubair was never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar, and `Uthman. (`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met `Abdullah bin Zubair and asked, \"O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?\" `Abdullah kept it as a secret and said, \"One hundred thousand,\" Hakim said, \"By Allah! I don't think your property will cover it.\" On that `Abdullah said to him, \"What if it is two million and two hundred thousand?\" Hakim said, \"I don't think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.\" Az- Zubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. `Abdullah sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, \"Any person who has any money claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.\" There came to him `Abdullah bin Ja`far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, \"If you wish I will forgive you the debt.\" `Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, \"No.\" Then Ibn Ja`far said, \"If you wish you can defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt.\" Ibn Az-Zubair said, \"No.\" `Abdullah bin Ja`far said, \"Give me a piece of the land.\" `Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to him), \"Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.\" So, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while `Amr bin `Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az- Zubair and Ibn Zam`a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya asked, \"At what price have you appraised Al- Ghaba?\" He said, \"One hundred thousand for each share,\" Muawiya asked, \"How many shares have been left?\" `Abdullah replied, \"Four and a half shares.\" Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" `Amr bin `Uthman said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Ibn Zam`a said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Muawiya said, \"How much is left now?\" `Abdullah replied, \"One share and a half.\" Muawiya said, \"I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand.\" `Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, \"Distribute our inheritance among us.\" He said, \"No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.\" So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand",

One of them called my attention saying, \"O Uncle! Do you know Abu Jahl?\" I said, \"Yes, What do you want from him, O my nephew?\" He said, \"I have been informed that he abuses Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). By Him in Whose Hands my life is, if I should see him, then my body will not leave his body till either of us meet his fate.\" I was astonished at that talk. Then the other boy called my attention saying the same as the other had said. After a while I saw Abu Jahl walking amongst the people. I said (to the boys), \"Look! This is the man you asked me about.\" So, both of them attacked him with their swords and struck him to death and returned to Allah'S Apostle to inform him of that. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Which of you has killed him?\" Each of them said, \"I Have killed him.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Have you cleaned your swords?\" They said, \"No. \" He then looked at their swords and said, \"No doubt, you both have killed him and the spoils of the deceased will be given to Mu`adh bin `Amr bin Al-Jamuh.\" The two boys were Mu`adh bin 'Afra and Mu`adh bin `Amr bin Al-Jamuh",

When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and I saw a pagan throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he released me. I followed `Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), \"What is wrong with the people (fleeing)?\" He replied, \"This is the Will of Allah,\" After the people returned, the Prophet (ﷺ) sat and said, \"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his spoils.\" I got up and said, \"Who will be a witness for me?\" and then sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) again said, \"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.\" I (again) got up and said, \"Who will be a witness for me?\" and sat down. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said the same for the third time. I again got up, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Abu Qatada! What is your story?\" Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me. So please compensate him on my behalf.\" On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, \"No, by Allah, he (i.e. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of Allah's Lions who fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Abu Bakr has spoken the truth.\" So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima, and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to Islam",

This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takes it without greed, then one is blessed in it, and if one takes it with greediness, then one is not blessed in it, and will be like the one who eats without satisfaction.

I will not ask anyone for anything after you till I leave this world.\" So, when Abu Bakr during his Caliphate, called Hakim to give him (some money), Hakim refused to accept anything from him. Once `Umar called him (during his Caliphate) in order to give him something, but Hakim refused to accept it, whereupon `Umar said, \"O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Hakim) his right which Allah has assigned to him) from this Fai '(booty), but he refuses to take it.\" So Hakim never took anything from anybody after the Prophet (ﷺ) till he died",
