    "text": "Harmala, the freed slave of Usama bin Zaid said that while he was in the company of 'Abdullah bin 'Umar, Al-Hajjaj bin Aiman came in and (while praying) he did not perform his bowing and prostrations properly. So Ibn 'Umar told him to repeat his prayer. When he went away, Ibn 'Umar asked me, \"Who is he?\" I said, \"Al-Hajjaj bin Um Aiman.\" Ibn 'Umar said, \"If Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw him, he would have loved him.\" Then Ibn 'Umar mentioned the love of the Prophet (ﷺ) for the children of Um Aiman. Sulaiman said that Um Aiman was one of the nurses of the Prophet",
