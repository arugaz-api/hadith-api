When `Umar asked for the permission to enter, the women quickly put on their veils. Allah'sf Apostle allowed him to enter and `Umar came in while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was smiling, `Umar said \"O Allah's Apostle! May Allah always keep you smiling.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"These women who have been here, roused my wonder, for as soon as they heard your voice, they quickly put on their veils. \"`Umar said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You have more right to be feared by them than I.\" Then `Umar addressed the women saying, \"O enemies of yourselves! You fear me more than you do Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?\" They said, \"Yes, for you are harsher and sterner than Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Ibn Al-Khattab! By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Never does Satan find you going on a way, but he takes another way other than yours","grades":[],"reference":{"book":62,"hadith":33}}}
