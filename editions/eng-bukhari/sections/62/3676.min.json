Then Ibn Al-Khattab took the bucket from Abu Bakr, and the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands. I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work. He drew so much water that the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels.\" (Wahab, a sub-narrator said, \"till their camels drank and knelt down)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":62,"hadith":26}}}
