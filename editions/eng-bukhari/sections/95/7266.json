    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:When the delegate of `Abd Al-Qais came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), he said, \"Who are the delegate?\" They said, \"The delegate are from the tribe of Rabi`a.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Welcome, O the delegate, and welcome! O people! Neither you will have any disgrace nor will you regret.\" They said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Between you and us there are the infidels of the tribe of Mudar, so please order us to do something good (religious deeds) that by acting on them we may enter Paradise, and that we may inform (our people) whom we have left behind, about it.\" They also asked (the Prophet) about drinks. He forbade them from four things and ordered them to do four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah, and asked them, \"Do you know what is meant by belief in Allah?\" They said, \"Allah and His Apostle know best.\" He said, ''To testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, the One, Who has no partners with Him, and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay Zakat.\" (the narrator thinks that fasting in Ramadan is included), \"and to give one-fifth of the war booty (to the state).\" Then he forbade four (drinking utensils): Ad-Duba', Al56 Hantam, Al-Mazaffat and An-Naqir, or probably, Al-Muqaiyar. And then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Remember all these things by heart and preach it to those whom you have left behind",
