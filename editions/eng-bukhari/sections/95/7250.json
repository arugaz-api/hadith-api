    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished his prayer after offerings two rak`at only. Dhul-Yaddain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced, or you had forgotten?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Is Dhul-Yaddain speaking the truth?\" The people said, \"Yes.\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up and performed another two rak`at and then finished prayer with Taslim, and then said the Takbir and performed a prostration similar to or longer than his ordinary prostrations; then he raised his head, said Takbir and prostrated and then raised his head (Sahu prostrations)",
