(2.144) Thus he was directed towards the Ka`ba. A man prayed the `Asr prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) and then went out, and passing by some people from the Ansar, he said, \"I testify. that I have prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) and he (the Prophet) has prayed facing the Ka`ba.\" Thereupon they, who were bowing in the `Asr prayer, turned towards the Ka`ba","grades":[],"reference":{"book":95,"hadith":7}}}
