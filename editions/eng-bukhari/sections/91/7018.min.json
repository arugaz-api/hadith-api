Then we shrouded him in his clothes. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to us, I (addressing the dead body) said, \"May Allah's Mercy be on you, O Aba As-Sa'ib! I testify that Allah has honored you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'How do you know that?' I replied, 'I do not know, by Allah.' He said, 'As for him, death has come to him and I wish him all good from Allah. By Allah, though I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I neither know what will happen to me, nor to you.'\" Um Al-`Ala said, \"By Allah, I will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that.\" She added, \"Later I saw in a dream, a flowing spring for `Uthman. So I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. He said, 'That is (the symbol of) his good deeds (the reward for) which is going on for him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":91,"hadith":35}}}
