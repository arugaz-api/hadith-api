Then the bucket turned into a very large one and `Umar bin Al-Khattab took it. I have never seen any strong man among the people, drawing water with such strength as `Umar did, till the people (drank to their satisfaction and) watered their camels to their fill; whereupon the camels sat beside the water","grades":[],"reference":{"book":91,"hadith":38}}}
