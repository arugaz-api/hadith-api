He used to say in his invocation, Allahumma ij`al fi qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam`i nuran, wa`an yamini nuran, wa`an yasari nuran, wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj`al li nuran.\" Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, \"I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned in this invocation).
