    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:Two persons, a Muslim and a Jew, quarreled. The Muslim said, \"By Him Who gave Muhammad superiority over all the people! The Jew said, \"By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the people!\" At that the Muslim raised his hand and slapped the Jew on the face. The Jew went to the Prophet and informed him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent for the Muslim and asked him about it. The Muslim informed him of the event. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Do not give me superiority over Moses, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall unconscious and I will be one of them, but I will. be the first to gain consciousness, and will see Moses standing and holding the side of the Throne (of Allah). I will not know whether (Moses) has also fallen unconscious and got up before me, or Allah has exempted him from that stroke",
