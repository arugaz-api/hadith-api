I sleep and my Lord makes me eat and drink.\" When the people refused to give up Al-Wisal, the Prophet (ﷺ) fasted along with them for one day, and did not break his fast but continued his fast for another day, and when they saw the crescent, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If the crescent had not appeared, I would have made you continue your fast (for a third day),\" as if he wanted to punish them for they had refused to give up Al-Wisal","grades":[],"reference":{"book":86,"hadith":73}}}
