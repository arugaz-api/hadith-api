    "text": "Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) in a gathering and he said, 'Swear allegiance to me that you will not worship anything besides Allah, Will not steal, and will not commit illegal sexual intercourse.\" And then (the Prophet) recited the whole Verse (i.e. 60:12). The Prophet (ﷺ) added, 'And whoever among you fulfills his pledge, his reward is with Allah; and whoever commits something of such sins and receives the legal punishment for it, that will be considered as the expiation for that sin, and whoever commits something of such sins and Allah screens him, it is up to Allah whether to excuse or punish him",
