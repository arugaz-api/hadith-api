The Prophet (ﷺ) turned Al-Fadl's face to the other side. She said, \"My father has come under Allah's obligation of performing Hajj but he is a very old man and cannot sit properly on his Mount. Shall I perform Hajj on his behalf? The Prophet (ﷺ) replied in the affirmative. That happened during Hajjat-al-Wada` of the Prophet (ﷺ)",
