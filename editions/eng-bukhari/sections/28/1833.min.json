It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly.' Al-`Abbas said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Except Al-Idhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.' The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, 'Except Al-Idhkhir.' \" `Ikrima said, 'Do you know what \"chasing or disturbing\" the game means? It means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place","grades":[],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":13}}}
