I went intending to uncover my father but my people forbade me; again I wanted to uncover him but my people forbade me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave his order and he was shifted away. At that time he heard the voice of a crying woman and asked, \"Who is this?\" They said, \"It is the daughter or the sister of `Amr.\" He said, \"Why does she weep? (or let her stop weeping), for the angels had been shading him with their wings till he (i.e. the body of the martyr) was shifted away","grades":[],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":51}}}
