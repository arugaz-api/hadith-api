    "text": "Narrated Sahl:A woman brought a woven Burda (sheet) having edging (border) to the Prophet, Then Sahl asked them whether they knew what is Burda, they said that Burda is a cloak and Sahl confirmed their reply. Then the woman said, \"I have woven it with my own hands and I have brought it so that you may wear it.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) accepted it, and at that time he was in need of it. So he came out wearing it as his waist-sheet. A man praised it and said, \"Will you give it to me? How nice it is!\" The other people said, \"You have not done the right thing as the Prophet (ﷺ) is in need of it and you have asked for it when you know that he never turns down anybody's request.\" The man replied, \"By Allah, I have not asked for it to wear it but to make it my shroud.\" Later it was his shroud",
