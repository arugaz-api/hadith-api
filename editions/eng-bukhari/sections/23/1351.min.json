I do not leave anyone after me dearer to me than you, except Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)'s soul and I owe some debt and you should repay it and treat your sisters favorably (nicely and politely).\" So in the morning he was the first to be martyred and was buried along with another (martyr). I did not like to leave him with the other (martyr) so I took him out of the grave after six months of his burial and he was in the same condition as he was on the day of burial, except a slight change near his ear","grades":[],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":105}}}
