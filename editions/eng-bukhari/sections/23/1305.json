    "text": "Narrated Aisha:When the news of the martyrdom of Zaid bin Haritha, Ja`far and `Abdullah bin Rawaha came, the Prophet sat down looking sad, and I was looking through the chink of the door. A man came and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The women of Ja`far,\" and then he mentioned their crying . The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered him to stop them from crying. The man went and came back and said, \"I tried to stop them but they disobeyed.\" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered him for the second time to forbid them. He went again and came back and said, \"They did not listen to me, (or \"us\": the sub-narrator Muhammad bin Haushab is in doubt as to which is right). \" (`Aisha added: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Put dust in their mouths.\" I said (to that man), \"May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you).\" By Allah, you could not (stop the women from crying) to fulfill the order, besides you did not relieve Allah's Apostle from fatigue",
