    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:We set out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said, \"Whoever wants to assume Ihram for `Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for `Umra.\" Some of the people assumed Ihram for `Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for `Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of `Arafat. I complained to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it, he said, \"Abandon your `Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj.\" So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet (ﷺ) sent `Abdur Rahman with me to at-Tan`im. The sub-narrator adds: He (`Abdur-Rahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for `Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and `Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her",
