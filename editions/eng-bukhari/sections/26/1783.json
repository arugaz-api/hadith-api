    "text": "Narrated Aisha:We set out along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, \"Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for `Umra may do so. Hadn't I brought the Hadi (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for `Umra.\" (`Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for `Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for `Umra. The day of `Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (ﷺ) (about that) and he said, \"Abandon your `Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;.\" When it was the night of Hasba, he sent `Abdur Rahman with me to at-Tan`im and I assumed Ihram for `Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed `Umra",
