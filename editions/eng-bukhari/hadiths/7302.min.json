Abu Bakr said to `Umar, \"You intended only to oppose me.\" `Umar said, \"I did not intend to oppose you!\" Then their voices grew louder in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) whereupon there was revealed: 'O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet..a great reward.' (49.2-3) Ibn Az-Zubair said, 'Thence forward when `Umar talked to the Prophet, he would talk like one who whispered a secret and would even fail to make the Prophet (ﷺ) hear him, in which case the Prophet (ﷺ) would ask him (to repeat his words)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":96,"hadith":33}}}
