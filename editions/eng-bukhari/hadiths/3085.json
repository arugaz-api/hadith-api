    "text": "Narrated Anas bin Malik:We were in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) while returning from 'Usfan, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was riding his she-camel keeping Safiya bint Huyay riding behind him. His she-camel slipped and both of them fell down. Abu Talha jumped from his camel and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May Allah sacrifice me for you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Take care of the lady.\" So, Abu Talha covered his face with a garment and went to Safiya and covered her with it, and then he set right the condition of their shecamel so that both of them rode, and we were encircling Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) like a cover. When we approached Medina, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising our Lord.\" He kept on saying this till he entered Medina",
