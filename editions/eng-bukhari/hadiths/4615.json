So we said (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ). \"Shall we castrate ourselves?\" But the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade us to do that and thenceforth he allowed us to marry a woman (temporarily) by giving her even a garment, and then he recited: \"O you who believe! Do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you",
