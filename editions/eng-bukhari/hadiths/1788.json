    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet (ﷺ) said to his companions, \"Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and likes to make it as `Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hadi with him should not do it.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the `Umra. The Prophet (ﷺ) came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, \"I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the `Umra.\" He asked me, \"What is the matter with you?\" I replied, \"I am not praying.\" He said, \"There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the `Umra as well.\" So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet (ﷺ) called `Abdur- Rahman and said, \"Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for `Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place.\" We came back at midnight and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked us, \"Have you finished?\" I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka`ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet (ﷺ) set out for Medina",
