    "text": "Al-Hasan bin Muslim told me that Ibn `Abbas had said, \"I joined the Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman in the `Id ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet (ﷺ) I came out (for the `Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following verse:'O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).' After finishing the recitation he said, \"O ladies! Are you fulfilling your covenant?\" None except one woman said, \"Yes.\" Hasan did not know who was that woman. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Then give alms.\" Bilal spread his garment and said, \"Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother sacrifice their lives for you (ladies).\" So the ladies kept on putting their Fatkhs (big rings) and other kinds of rings in Bilal's garment.\" `Abdur-Razaq said, \" 'Fatkhs' is a big ring which used to be worn in the (Pre-Islamic) period of ignorance",
