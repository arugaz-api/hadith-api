Al-Miqdad said, \"We will not say as the People of Moses said: Go you and your Lord and fight you two. (5.27). But we shall fight on your right and on your left and in front of you and behind you.\" I saw the face of the Prophet (ﷺ) getting bright with happiness, for that saying delighted him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":4}}}
