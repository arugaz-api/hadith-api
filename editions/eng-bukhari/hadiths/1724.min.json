He asked me, \"Have you intended to perform the Hajj?\" I replied in the affirmative. He asked, \"For what have you assumed lhram?\" I replied,\" I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet (ﷺ) .\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You have done well! Go and perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa.\" Then I went to one of the women of Bani Qais and she took out lice from my head. Later, I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. So, I used to give this verdict to the people till the caliphate of `Umar. When I told him about it, he said, \"If we take (follow) the Holy Book, then it orders us to complete Hajj and `Umra (Hajj-at- Tamattu`) and if we follow the tradition of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not finish his lhram till the Hadi had reached its destination (had been slaughtered).
