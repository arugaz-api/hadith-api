    "text": "Narrated `Uthman bin Mauhab:A man came to perform the Hajj to (Allah's) House. Seeing some people sitting, he said, \"Who are these sitting people?\" Somebody said, \"They are the people of Quraish.\" He said, \"Who is the old man?\" They said, \"Ibn `Umar.\" He went to him and said, \"I want to ask you about something; will you tell me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of this (Sacred) House, do you know that `Uthman bin `Affan fled on the day of Uhud?\" Ibn `Umar said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Do you know that he (i.e. `Uthman) was absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?\" Ibn `Umar said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Do you know that he failed to be present at the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiya) and did not witness it?\" Ibn `Umar replied, \"Yes,\" He then said, \"Allahu- Akbar!\" Ibn `Umar said, \"Come along; I will inform you and explain to you what you have asked.

As for his absence from the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance if there had been anybody more respected by the Meccans than `Uthman bin `Affan, the Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of `Uthman. So the Prophet (ﷺ) sent him (i.e. `Uthman to Mecca) and the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance took place after `Uthman had gone to Mecca. The Prophet raised his right hand saying. 'This is the hand of `Uthman,' and clapped it over his other hand and said, \"This is for `Uthman.'\" Ibn `Umar then said (to the man), \"Go now, after taking this information",
