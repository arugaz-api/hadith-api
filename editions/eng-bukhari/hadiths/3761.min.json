Weren't there amongst you the man who was given Allah's Refuge from the Satan? And weren't there amongst you the man who used to keep the (Prophet's) secrets which nobody else knew? How did Ibn Um `Abd (i.e. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud) use to recite Surat-al-lail (the Night:92)?\" I recited:-- \"By the Night as it envelops By the Day as it appears in brightness. And by male and female.\" (92.1- 3) On that, Abu Darda said, \"By Allah, the Prophet (ï·º) made me read the Verse in this way after listening to him, but these people (of Sham) tried their best to let me say something different","grades":[],"reference":{"book":62,"hadith":106}}}
