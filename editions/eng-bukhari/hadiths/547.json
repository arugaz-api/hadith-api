    "text": "Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:I along with my father went to Abu- Barza Al-Aslami and my father asked him, \"How Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to offer the five compulsory congregational prayers?\" Abu- Barza said, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray the Zuhr prayer which you (people) call the first one at midday when the sun had just declined The `Asr prayer at a time when after the prayer, a man could go to the house at the farthest place in Medina (and arrive) while the sun was still hot. (I forgot about the Maghrib prayer). The Prophet (ﷺ) Loved to delay the `Isha which you call Al- `Atama [??] and he disliked sleeping before it and speaking after it. After the Fajr prayer he used to leave when a man could recognize the one sitting beside him and he used to recite between 60 to 100 Ayat (in the Fajr prayer)",
