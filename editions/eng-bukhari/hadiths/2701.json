So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he would perform `Umra the following year and would not carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca except for the period they allowed. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) performed the `Umra in the following year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, the pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed",
