    "text": "Anas said:One of the Ansar used to lead the Ansar in Salat in the Quba' mosque and it was his habit to recite Qul Huwal-lahu Ahad whenever he wanted to recite something in Salat. When he finished that Surah, he would recite another one with it. He followed the same procedure in each Rak'a. His companions discussed this with him and said, \"You recite this Surah and do not consider it sufficient and then you recite another. So would you recite it alone or leave it and recite some other.\" He said, \"I will never leave it and if you want me to be your Imam on this condition then it is all right ; otherwise I will leave you.\" They knew that he was the best amongst them and they did not like someone else to lead them in Salat. When the Prophet (ﷺ) went to them as usual, they informed him about it. The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed him and said, \"O so-and-so, what forbids you from doing what your companions ask you to do ? Why do you read this Surah particularly in every Rak'a ?\" He repiled, \"I love this Surah.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Your love for this Surah will make you enter Paradise",
