The Prophet (ﷺ) sent for him, and on his arrival, he asked him whether he had beaten the Jew. He (replied in the affirmative and) said, \"I heard him taking an oath in the market saying, 'By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the human beings.' I said, 'O wicked man! (Has Allah given Moses superiority) even over Muhammad I became furious and slapped him over his face.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Do not give a prophet superiority over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall unconscious and I will be the first to emerge from the earth, and will see Moses standing and holding one of the legs of the Throne. I will not know whether Moses has fallen unconscious or the first unconsciousness was sufficient for him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":44,"hadith":3}}}
