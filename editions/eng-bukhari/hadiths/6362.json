Behold ! There was a man who, on quarreling with the people, used to be called as a son of a person other than h is father. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Who is my father?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"Your father is Hudhaifa.\" And then `Umar got up and said, \"We accept Allah as our Lord, and Islam as (our) religion, and Muhammad as (our) Apostle; and we seek refuge with Allah from the afflictions.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \" I have never seen a day like today in its good and its evil for Paradise and the Hell Fire were displayed in front of me, till I saw them just beyond this wall.\" Qatada, when relating this Hadith, used to mention the following Verse:-- 'O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which, If made plain to you, May cause you trouble",
