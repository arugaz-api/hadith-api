    "text": "Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:We took part in the Ghazwa of Najd along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and when the time for the afternoon rest approached while he was in a valley with plenty of thorny trees, he dismounted under a tree and rested in its shade and hung his sword (on it). The people dispersed amongst the trees in order to have shade. While we were in this state, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called us and we came and found a bedouin sitting in front of him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This (Bedouin) came to me while I was asleep, and he took my sword stealthily. I woke up while he was standing by my head, holding my sword without its sheath. He said, 'Who will save you from me?' I replied, 'Allah.' So he sheathed it (i.e. the sword) and sat down, and here he is.\" But Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not punish him",
