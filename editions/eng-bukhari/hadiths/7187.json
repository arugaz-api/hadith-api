The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to the people), \"If you are criticizing his leadership now, then you used to criticize his father's leadership before. By Allah, he (Usama's father) deserved the leadership and used to be one of the most beloved persons to me, and now his son (Usama) is one of the most beloved persons to me after him. \" (See Hadith No. 745, Vol)",
