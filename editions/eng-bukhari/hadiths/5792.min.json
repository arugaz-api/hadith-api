She said, 'O Allah s Apostle! I was the wife of Rifa`a and he divorced me irrevocably. Then I married `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair who, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), has only something like a fringe of a garment, Showing the fringe of her veil. Khalid bin Sa`id, who was standing at the door, for he had not been admitted, heard her statement and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Why do you not stop this lady from saying such things openly before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" No, by Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did nothing but smiled. Then he said to the lady, \"Perhaps you want to return to Rifa`a? That is impossible unless `Abdur-Rahman consummates his marriage with you.\" That became the tradition after him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":77,"hadith":10}}}
