{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":5470,"arabicnumber":5470,"text":"Narrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, \"How does my son fare?\" Um Salaim (his wife) replied, \"He is quieter than he has ever been.\" Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), \"Bury the child (as he's dead).\" Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him about that. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), \"Did you sleep with your wife last night?\" Abu Talha said, \"Yes\". The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.\" Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet (ﷺ) and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet (ﷺ) took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, \"Yes, a few dates.\" The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child's mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him 'Abdullah","grades":[],"reference":{"book":71,"hadith":4}}}
