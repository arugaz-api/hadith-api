The man has not nursed me but his wife has nursed me.\" He said, \"Admit him because he is your uncle (not from blood relation, but because you have been nursed by his wife), Taribat Yaminuki.\" `Urwa said, \"Because of this reason, ' Aisha used to say: Foster suckling relations render all those things (marriages etc.) illegal which are illegal because of the corresponding blood relations.\" (See Hadith No. 36, Vol)",
