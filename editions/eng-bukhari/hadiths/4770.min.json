Abu Lahab and other people from Quraish came and the Prophet (ﷺ) then said, \"Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?\" They said, \"Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth.\" He then said, \"I am a warner to you in face of a terrific punishment.\" Abu Lahab said (to the Prophet) \"May your hands perish all this day. Is it for this purpose you have gathered us?\" Then it was revealed: \"Perish the hands of Abu Lahab (one of the Prophet's uncles), and perish he! His wealth and his children will not profit him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":292}}}
