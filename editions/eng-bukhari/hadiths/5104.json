    "text": "Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith:I married a woman and then a black lady came to us and said, \"I have suckled you both (you and your wife).\" So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"I married so-and-so and then a black lady came to us and said to me, 'I have suckled both of you.' But I think she is a liar.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) turned his face away from me and I moved to face his face, and said, \"She is a liar.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"How (can you keep her as your wife) when that lady has said that she has suckled both of you? So abandon (i.e., divorce) her (your wife)",
