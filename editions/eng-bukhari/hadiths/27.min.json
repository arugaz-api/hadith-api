He is a faithful believer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) again said, \"Or merely a Muslim.\" And I could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Sa'd! I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his face in the Fire by Allah","grades":[],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":20}}}
