When she got up to return, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up with her and accompanied her, and when he reached near the gate of the Mosque close to the door (of the house) of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by them and greeted Allah's Apostle and then went away. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) addressed them saying, \"Don't hurry! (She is my wife),\" They said, \"Glorified be Allah! O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (You are far away from any suspicion),\" and his saying was hard on them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Satan circulates in the mind of a person as blood does (in his body). I was afraid that Satan might put some (evil) thoughts in your minds","grades":[],"reference":{"book":57,"hadith":10}}}
