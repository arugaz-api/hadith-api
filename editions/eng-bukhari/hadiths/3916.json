    "text": "Narrated Abu `Uthman:I heard that Ibn `Umar used to become angry if someone mentioned that he had migrated before his father (`Umar), and he used to say, \" `Umar and I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and found him having his midday rest, so we returned home. Then `Umar sent me again (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and said, 'Go and see whether he is awake.' I went to him and entered his place and gave him the pledge of allegiance. Then I went back to `Umar and informed him that the Prophet (ﷺ) was awake. So we both went, running slowly, and when `Umar entered his place, he gave him the pledge of allegiance and thereafter I too gave him the pledge of allegiance",
