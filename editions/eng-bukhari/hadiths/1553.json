    "text": "Narrated Nafi', 'Whenever Ibn 'Umar finished his morning Salat at Dhul-Hulaifa he would get his Rahila (mount) prepared. Then, he would ride on it, and after it had stood up straight (ready to set out), he would face Al-Qiblah (the Ka,bah at Makkah) while sitting (on his mount) and recite Talbiya. When he had reached the boundaries of the Haram (or Makkah), he would stop recitation of Talbiya till he reached Dhi-Tuwa (near Makkah) where he would pass the night till it was dawn. After offering the morning Salat, he would take a bath. He claimed that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) had done the same",
