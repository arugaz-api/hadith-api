Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) looked at us and smiled till his premolar tooth became visible. Then the Jew further said, \"Shall I tell you of the udm (additional food taken with bread) they will have with the bread?\" He added, \"That will be Balam and Nun.\" The people asked, \"What is that?\" He said, \"It is an ox and a fish, and seventy thousand people will eat of the caudate lobe (i.e. extra lobe) of their livers","grades":[],"reference":{"book":81,"hadith":109}}}
