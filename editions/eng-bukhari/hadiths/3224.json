    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:I stuffed for the Prophet (ﷺ) a pillow decorated with pictures (of animals) which looked like a Namruqa (i.e. a small cushion). He came and stood between the two doors and his face began to change. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What did we do wrong?\" He said, \"What is this pillow?\" I said, \"I have prepared this pillow for you, so that you may recline on it.\" He said, \"Don't you know that angels do not enter a house wherein there are pictures; and whoever makes a picture will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked to give life to (what he has created)?",
