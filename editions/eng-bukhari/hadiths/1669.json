    "text": "Narrated Usama bin Zaid:I rode behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from `Arafat and when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached the mountain pass on the left side which is before Al-Muzdalifa he made his camel kneel and then urinated, and then I poured water for his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He replied, \"The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al- Muzdalifa).\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin `Abbas) rode behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Kuraib, (a sub-narrator) said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas narrated from Al-Fadl, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) kept on reciting Talbiya (during the journey) till he reached the Jamra.\" (Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba)",
