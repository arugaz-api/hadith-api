    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Umar:When the Prophet (ﷺ) returned from the battle of Al-Ahzab (The confederates), he said to us, \"None should offer the 'Asr prayer but at Bani Quraiza.\" The 'Asr prayer became due for some of them on the way. Some of them decided not to offer the Salat but at Bani Quraiza while others decided to offer the Salat on the spot and said that the intention of the Prophet (ﷺ) was not what the former party had understood. And when that was told to the Prophet (ﷺ) he did not blame anyone of them",
