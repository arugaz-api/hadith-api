{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4101,"arabicnumber":4101,"text":"Narrated Jabir:We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq ( i.e. Trench )) and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"Here is a rock appearing across the trench.\" He said, \"I am coming down.\" Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not eaten anything for three days. So the Prophet (ﷺ) took the spade and struck the big solid rock and it became like sand. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to go home.\" (When the Prophet (ﷺ) allowed me) I said to my wife, \"I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) in a state that I cannot treat lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?\" She replied, \"I have barley and a she goat.\" So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) when the dough had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly been well-cooked, and said, \"I have got a little food prepared, so get up O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), you and one or two men along with you (for the food).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, \"How much is that food?\" I told him about it. He said, \"It is abundant and good. Tell your wife not to remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out any bread from the oven till I reach there.\" Then he said (to all his companions), \"Get up.\" So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When I came to my wife, I said, \"Allah's Mercy be upon you! The Prophet came along with the Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present with them.\" She said, \"Did the Prophet (ﷺ) ask you (how much food you had)?\" I replied, \"Yes.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Enter and do not throng.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) started cutting the bread (into pieces) and put the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his companions and take the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread and scooping the meat (for his companions) till they all ate their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to my wife), \"Eat and present to others as the people are struck with hunger","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":145}}}
