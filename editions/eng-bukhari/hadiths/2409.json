    "text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, \"Everyone of you is a guardian, and responsible for what is in his custody. The ruler is a guardian of his subjects and responsible for them; a husband is a guardian of his family and is responsible for it; a lady is a guardian of her husband's house and is responsible for it, and a servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for it.\" I heard that from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I think that the Prophet (ﷺ) also said, \"A man is a guardian of is father's property and is responsible for it, so all of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and things under your care",
