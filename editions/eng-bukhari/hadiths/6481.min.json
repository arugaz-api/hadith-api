The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"When the time of his death approached, he asked his children, 'What type of father have I been to you?' They replied: You have been a good father. He said, 'But he (i.e. your father) has not stored any good deeds with Allah (for the Hereafter): if he should face Allah, Allah will punish him. So listen, (O my children), when I die, burn my body till I become mere coal and then grind it into powder, and when there is a stormy wind, throw me (my ashes) in it.' So he took a firm promise from his children (to follow his instructions). And by Allah they (his sons) did accordingly(fulfilled their promise.) Then Allah said, \"Be\"' and behold! That man was standing there! Allah then said. \"O my slave! What made you do what you did?\" That man said, \"Fear of You.\" So Allah forgave him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":81,"hadith":70}}}
