I suggested that his creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full debt. So, I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him about it. He said (to me), \"When you pluck the dates and collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)).\" Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and `Umar and sat on the dates and invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, \"Call your creditors and give them their full rights.\" So, I paid all my father's creditors in full and yet thirteen extra Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were 'Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at sunset and informed him about it. On that he smiled and said, \"Go to Abu Bakr and `Umar and tell them about it.\" They said, \"We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did what he did","grades":[],"reference":{"book":53,"hadith":19}}}
