The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O people! Be kind to yourselves, for you are not calling upon a deaf or an absent one, but You are calling an All-Hearer, and an All-Seer.\" Then he came to me as I was reciting silently, \"La haul a wala quwwata illa bil-lah.\" He said, \"O `Abdullah bin Qais! Say: La haul a walaquwata illa bil-lah, for it is one of the treasures of Paradise.\" Or he said, \"Shall I tell you a word which is one of the treasures of Paradise? It is: La haul a wala quwwata illa bil-lah","grades":[],"reference":{"book":80,"hadith":79}}}
