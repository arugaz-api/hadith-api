So he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"I will ask you about three things which nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?'. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Just now Gabriel has informed me about that.\" `Abdullah said, \"Gabriel?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" `Abdullah said, \"He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews.\" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) recited this Holy Verse:-- \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission.\" (2.97) Then he added, \"As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man's discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman's discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother.\" On hearing that, `Abdullah said, \"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Messenger of Allah, O, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar.\" In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, \"What is `Abdullah's status amongst you?\" They replied, \"He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What would you think if `Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?\" They replied, \"May Allah protect him from this!\" Then `Abdullah came out and said, \"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\" The Jews then said, \"Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,\" and disparaged him. On that `Abdullah said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is what I was afraid of","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":7}}}
