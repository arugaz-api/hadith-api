    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:We went out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaish where my necklace got broken (and lost). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stopped to search for it and the people too stopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went to Abu Bakr and said, \"Don't you see what `Aisha has done? She has made Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the people stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Allah's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, \"You detained Allah Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water.\" He then admonished me and said what Allah wished and pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was on my thigh . Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. \"O family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessings of yours.\" We urged the camel on which I was sitting to get up from its place and the necklace was found under it",
