And if we return to Medina, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner. \"I mentioned that to my uncle who, in turn, mentioned it to the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) called me and I told him about that. Then he sent for `Abdullah bin Ubai and his companions, and they swore that they did not say so. The Prophet (ﷺ) disbelieved my statement and believed theirs. I was distressed as I have never been before, and I remained in my house. My uncle said to me, \"You just wanted the Prophet (ﷺ) to consider you a liar and hate you.\" Then Allah revealed:-- 'When the hypocrites come to you, they say: 'We bear witness that you are indeed the Apostle of Allah.\" (63.1) So the Prophet (ﷺ) sent for me and recited it and said, \"Allah has confirmed your statement","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":424}}}
