In our land there is an alcoholic drink (prepared) from barley called Al-Mizr, and another (prepared) from honey, called Al-Bit\"' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"All intoxicants are prohibited.\" Then both of them proceeded and Mu`adh asked Abu Musa, \"How do you recite the Qur'an?\" Abu Musa replied, \"I recite it while I am standing, sitting or riding my riding animals, at intervals and piecemeal.\" Mu`adh said, \"But I sleep and then get up. I sleep and hope for Allah's Reward for my sleep as I seek His Reward for my night prayer.\" Then he (i.e. Mu`adh) pitched a tent and they started visiting each other.
