    "text": "Narrated Anas:When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, the Prophet (ﷺ) confronted the tribe of Hawazin while there were ten-thousand (men) besides the Tulaqa' (i.e. those who had embraced Islam on the day of the Conquest of Mecca) with the Prophet. When they (i.e. Muslims) fled, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O the group of Ansari\" They replied, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Sadaik! We are under your command.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) got down (from his mule) and said, \"I am Allah's Slave and His Apostle.\" Then the pagans were defeated. The Prophet (ﷺ) distributed the war booty amongst the Tulaqa and Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) and did not give anything to the Ansar. So the Ansar spoke (i.e. were dissatisfied) and he called them and made them enter a leather tent and said, Won't you be pleased that the people take the sheep and camels, and you take Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with you?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"If the people took their way through a valley and the Ansar took their way through a mountain pass, then I would choose a mountain pass of the Ansar",
