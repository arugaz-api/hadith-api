    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Abbas:The Prophet (ﷺ) set out with the intention of going to Suq `Ukaz (market of `Ukaz) along with some of his companions. At the same time, a barrier was put between the devils and the news of heaven. Fire commenced to be thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who asked them, \"What is wrong with you?\" They said, \"A barrier has been placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at us.\" They said, \"The thing which has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven.\" Those who went towards Tuhama came across the Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq `Ukaz and the Prophet (ﷺ) was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Qur'an they listened to it and said, \"By Allah, this is the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven.\" They went to their people and said, \"O our people; verily we have heard a wonderful recital (Qur'an) which shows the true path; we believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our Lord.\" Allah revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura 'Jinn') (72): \"Say: It has been revealed to me.\" And what was revealed to him was the conversation of the Jinns",
