A rider overtook me and pricked my camel with a spear which he had, whereupon my camel started running as fast as any other fast camel you may see. I looked back, and behold, the rider was Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I am newly married \" He asked, \"Have you got married?\" I replied, \"Yes.\" He said, \"A virgin or a matron?\" I replied, \"(Not a virgin) but a matron\" He said, \"Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you could play with her and she with you?\" When we reached (near Medina) and were going to enter it, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Wait till you enter your home early in the night so that the lady whose hair is unkempt may comb her hair and that the lady whose husband has been away may shave her pubic hair",
