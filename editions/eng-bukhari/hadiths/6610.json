    "text": "Narrated Abu Musa:While we were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in a holy battle, we never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with Takbir. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came close to us and said, \"O people! Don't exert yourselves, for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All- Listener, the All-Seer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, \"O `Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I teach you a sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): 'La haula wala quwata illa billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Allah)",
