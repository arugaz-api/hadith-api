The man said, \"By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this. Please, teach me how to pray.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"When you stand for Prayer say Takbir and then recite from the Holy Qur'an (of what you know by heart) and then bow till you feel at ease. Then raise your head and stand up straight, then prostrate till you feel at ease during your prostration, then sit with calmness till you feel at ease (do not hurry) and do the same in all your prayers","grades":[],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":151}}}
