    "text": "Narrated Abu Sa`id:The Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned a man from the people of the past or those who preceded you. The Prophet (ﷺ) said a sentence meaning: Allah had given him wealth and children. When his death approached, he said to his sons, \"What kind of father have I been to you?\" They replied, \"You have been a good father.\" He told them that he had not presented any good deed before Allah, and if Allah should get hold of him He would punish him.' \"So look!\" he added, \"When I die, burn me, and when I turn into coal, crush me, and when there comes a windy day, scatter my ashes in the wind.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Then by Allah, he took a firm promise from his children to do so, and they did so. (They burnt him after his death) and threw his ashes on a windy day. Then Allah commanded to his ashes. \"Be,\" and behold! He became a man standing! Allah said, \"O My slave! What made you do what you did?\" He replied, \"For fear of You.\" Nothing saved him then but Allah's Mercy (So Allah forgave him)",
