The man said, \"I cannot do that.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"(Then) feed sixty poor persons.\" The man said, \"I have nothing (to feed them with).\" Then a big basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Where is the questioner? Go and give this in charity.\" The man said, \"(Shall I give this in charity) to a poorer person than l? By Allah, there is no family in between these two mountains (of Medina) who are poorer than we.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then smiled till his premolar teeth became visible, and said, \"Then (feed) your (family with it)",
