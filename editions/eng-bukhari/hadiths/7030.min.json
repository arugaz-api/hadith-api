I used to sleep in the mosque. Anyone who had a dream, would narrate it to the Prophet. I said, \"O Allah! If there is any good for me with You, then show me a dream so that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) may interpret it for me.\" So I slept and saw (in a dream) two angels came to me and took me along with them, and they met another angel who said to me, \"Don't be afraid, you are a good man.\" They took me towards the Fire, and behold, it was built inside like a well, and therein I saw people some of whom I recognized, and then the angels took me to the right side. In the morning, I mentioned that dream to Hafsa. Hafsa told me that she had mentioned it to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said, \"`Abdullah is a righteous man if he only prays more at night.\" (Az-Zuhri said, \"After that, `Abdullah used to pray more at night)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}}
