    "text": "Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:I asked `Uthman bin `Affan about a man who engaged in the sexual intercourse with his wife but did not discharge. `Uthman replied, \"He should perform ablution like that for the prayer after washing his private parts.\" `Uthman added, \"I heard that from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" I asked `Ali bin Abi Talib, Az- Zubair bin Al-`Awwam, Talha bin 'Ubaidullah and Ubai bin Ka`b and they gave the same reply. (Abu Aiyub said that he had heard that from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ) (This order was canceled later on so one has to take a bath. See, Hadith No)",
