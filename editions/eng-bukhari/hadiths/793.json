    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:Once the Prophet (ï·º) entered the mosque, a man came in, offered the prayer and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet returned his greeting and said to him, \"Go back and pray again for you have not prayed.\" The man offered the prayer again, came back and greeted the Prophet. He said to him thrice, \"Go back and pray again for you have not prayed.\" The man said, \"By Him Who has sent you with the truth! I do not know a better way of praying. Kindly teach Me how to pray.\" He said, \"When you stand for the prayer, say Takbir and then recite from the Qur'an what you know and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease, then rise from bowing till you stand straight. Afterwards prostrate calmly till you feel at ease and then raise (your head) and sit with Calmness till you feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness till you feel at ease in prostration and do the same in the whole of your prayer",
