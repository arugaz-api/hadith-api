We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till dawn, and set out with the Prophet (ﷺ) but (I suffered so much that) I wished I had taken the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as Sauda had done, and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness","grades":[],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":161}}}
