Call the Prophet (ﷺ) for me.\" I found it hard to do so, so I said surprisingly, \"Shall I call Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for you ?\" My father said, \"O mu son! He is not a tyrant.\" So I called him and he came out wearing a Dibaj cloak having gold buttons, and said: \"O Makhrama, I kept this for you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then gave it to him","grades":[],"reference":{"book":77,"hadith":79}}}
