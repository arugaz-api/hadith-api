My emigrant brothers were busy in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) content with what fills my stomach; so I used to be present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) once said, \"Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it to himself, will remember whatever I will say.\" So, I spread my colored garment which I was wearing till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished his saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any of that narrations","grades":[],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":1}}}
