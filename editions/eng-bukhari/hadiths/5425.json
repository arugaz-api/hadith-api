    "text": "Narrated Anas bin Malik:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Abu Talha, \"Seek one of your boys to serve me.\" Abu Talha mounted me behind him (on his riding animal) and took me (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ). So I used to serve Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whenever he dismounted (to stay somewhere). I used to hear him saying very often, \"O Allah! I seek refuge with You from, having worries sadness, helplessness, laziness, miserliness, cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other persons unjustly.\" I kept on serving till we -returned from the battle of Khaibar. The Prophet (ﷺ) then brought Safiyya bint Huyai whom he had won from the war booty. I saw him folding up a gown or a garment for her to sit on behind him (on his shecamel). When he reached As-Sahba', he prepared Hais and placed it on a dining sheet. Then he sent me to invite men, who (came and) ate; and that was his and Safiyya's wedding banquet. Then the Prophet proceeded, and when he saw (noticed) the mountain of Uhud, he said, \"This mountain loves us, and we love it.\" When we approached Medina, he said, \"O Allah! I make the area between its two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham has made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless their Mudd and Sa (special kinds of measure)",
