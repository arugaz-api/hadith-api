The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Recognize its container and its tying material and then make a public announcement about it for one year and if its owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise use it as you like.\" The man said, \"What about a lost sheep?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"It is for you, your brother or the wolf.\" The man said \"What about a lost camel?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Why should you take it as it has got its water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?",
