    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:A man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while he was in the mosque, and he called him, saying, \"O Allah's Apostle! I have committed illegal sexual intercourse.'\" The Prophet (ﷺ) turned his face to the other side, but that man repeated his statement four times, and after he bore witness against himself four times, the Prophet (ﷺ) called him, saying, \"Are you mad?\" The man said, \"No.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Are you married?\" The man said, \"Yes.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Take him away and stone him to death.\" Jabir bin `Abdullah said: I was among the ones who participated in stoning him and we stoned him at the Musalla. When the stones troubled him, he fled, but we over took him at Al-Harra and stoned him to death",
