When I went to demand its price, he said, \"I will not give it to you till you disbelieve in Muhammad.\" I said, \"I shall not disbelieve in Muhammad till Allah make you die and then bring you to life again.\" He said, \"If Allah should make me die and then resurrect me and I would have wealth and children.\" So Allah revealed:-- 'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our Signs, and (yet) says I shall certainly be given wealth and children? Has he known the unseen or has he taken a covenant from (Allah) the Beneficent?",
