He said, \"Is he in debt?\" The people replied in the negative. He said, \"Has he left any wealth?\" They said, \"No.\" So, he led his funeral prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Lead his funeral prayer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Is he in debt?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Has he left any wealth?\" They said, ''Three Dinars.\" So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was brought and the people said (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ), Please lead his funeral prayer.\" He said, \"Has he left any wealth?\" They said, \"No.\" He asked, \"Is he in debt?\" They said, (\"Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.', He (refused to pray and) said, \"Then pray for your (dead) companion.\" Abu Qatada said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Lead his funeral prayer, and I will pay his debt.\" So, he led the prayer",
