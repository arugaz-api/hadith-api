    "text": "Narrated Anas:A man asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment) saying, \"When will the Hour be?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What have you prepared for it?\" The man said, \"Nothing, except that I love Allah and His Apostle.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You will be with those whom you love.\" We had never been so glad as we were on hearing that saying of the Prophet (i.e., \"You will be with those whom you love.\") Therefore, I love the Prophet, Abu Bakr and `Umar, and I hope that I will be with them because of my love for them though my deeds are not similar to theirs",
