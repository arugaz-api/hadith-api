May Allah make me be sacrificed for you. Doesn't Allah say: \"Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand, he surely will receive an easy reckoning.?\" (84.7-8) He replied, \"That is only the presentation of the accounts; but he whose record is questioned, will be ruined.\" (This hadith is also narrated through two other chains)",
