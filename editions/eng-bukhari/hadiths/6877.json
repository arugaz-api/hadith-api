    "text": "Narrated Anas bin Malik:A girl wearing ornaments, went out at Medina. Somebody struck her with a stone. She was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) while she was still alive. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked her, \"Did such-and-such a person strike you?\" She raised her head, denying that. He asked her a second time, saying, \"Did so-and-so strike you?\" She raised her head, denying that. He said for the third time, \"Did so-and-so strike you?\" She lowered her head, agreeing. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then sent for the killer and killed him between two stones",
