Later I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and the Ansar doing the same. My mother (Asma') told me that she, her sister (`Aisha), Az-Zubair and such and such persons assumed Ihram for `Umra, and after they passed their hands over the Black Stone Corner (of the Ka`ba) they finished the Ihram. (i.e. After doing Tawaf of the Ka`ba and Sa`i between Safa-Marwa)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}}
