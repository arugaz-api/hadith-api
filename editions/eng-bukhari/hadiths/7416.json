    "text": "Narrated Al-Mughira:Sa`d bin 'Ubada said, \"If I saw a man with my wife, I would strike him (behead him) with the blade of my sword.\" This news reached Allah's Messenger (ï·º) who then said, \"You people are astonished at Sa`d's Ghira. By Allah, I have more Ghira than he, and Allah has more Ghira than I, and because of Allah's Ghira, He has made unlawful Shameful deeds and sins (illegal sexual intercourse etc.) done in open and in secret. And there is none who likes that the people should repent to Him and beg His pardon than Allah, and for this reason He sent the warners and the givers of good news. And there is none who likes to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason, Allah promised to grant Paradise (to the doers of good).\" `Abdul Malik said, \"No person has more Ghira than Allah",
