I do not remember if any Adhan or Iqama were pronounced for the prayer. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered (the women) to give alms, and they started stretching out their hands towards their ears and throats (giving their ornaments in charity), and the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered Bilal to go to them (to collect the alms), and then Bilal returned to the Prophet",
