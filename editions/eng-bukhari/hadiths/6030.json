You should be kind and lenient, and beware of harshness and Fuhsh (i.e. bad words).\" She said (to the Prophet), \"Haven't you heard what they (Jews) have said?\" He said, \"Haven't you heard what I have said (to them)? I said the same to them, and my invocation against them will be accepted while theirs against me will be rejected (by Allah)",
