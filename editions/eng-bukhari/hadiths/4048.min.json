The Muslims fled and he said, \"O Allah ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done.\" Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu'adh (fleeing), and asked him, \"Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud.\" Then he proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers. He had over 80 wounds caused by stabbing, striking or shooting with arrows","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":94}}}
