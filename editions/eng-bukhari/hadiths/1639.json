He (the son of Ibn `Umar) said, \"I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka`ba. I suggest that you should stay here.\" Ibn `Umar said, \"Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka`ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka`ba, I would do the same as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done . . . \"Verily, in Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) you have a good example.\" Then he added, \"I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with `Umra.\" After arriving at Mecca, Ibn `Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa)",
