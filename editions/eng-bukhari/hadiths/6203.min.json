{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":6203,"arabicnumber":6203,"text":"Narrated Anas:The Prophet (ﷺ) was the best of all the people in character. I had a brother called Abu `Umar, who, I think, had been newly weaned. Whenever he (that child) was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) the Prophet (ﷺ) used to say, \"O Abu `Umar! What did Al-Nughair (nightingale) (do)?\" It was a nightingale with which he used to play. Sometimes the time of the Prayer became due while he (the Prophet) was in our house. He would order that the carpet underneath him be swept and sprayed with water, and then he would stand up (for the prayer) and we would line up behind him, and he would lead us in prayer","grades":[],"reference":{"book":78,"hadith":227}}}
