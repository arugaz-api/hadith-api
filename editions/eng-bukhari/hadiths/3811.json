    "text": "Narrated Anas:On the day of the battle of Uhud, the people ran away, leaving the Prophet (ﷺ) , but Abu- Talha was shielding the Prophet (ﷺ) with his shield in front of him. Abu Talha was a strong, experienced archer who used to keep his arrow bow strong and well stretched. On that day he broke two or three arrow bows. If any man passed by carrying a quiver full of arrows, the Prophet (ﷺ) would say to him, \"Empty it in front of Abu Talha.\" When the Prophet (ﷺ) stated looking at the enemy by raising his head, Abu Talha said, \"O Allah's Prophet! Let my parents be sacrificed for your sake! Please don't raise your head and make it visible, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. Let my neck and chest be wounded instead of yours.\" (On that day) I saw `Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim both lifting their dresses up so that I was able to see the ornaments of their legs, and they were carrying the water skins of their arms to pour the water into the mouths of the thirsty people and then go back and fill them and come to pour the water into the mouths of the people again. (On that day) Abu Talha's sword fell from his hand twice or thrice",
