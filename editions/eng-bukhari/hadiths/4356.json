    "text": "Narrated Qais:Jarir said to me, The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, \"Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?\" And that was a house (in Yemem belonging to the tribe of) Khatham called Al-Ka`ba Al Yamaniya. I proceeded with one-hundred and-fifty cavalry from Ahmas (tribe) who were horse riders. I used not to sit firm on horses, so the Prophet (ﷺ) stroke me over my chest till I saw the mark of his fingers over my chest, and then he said, 'O Allah! Make him (i.e. Jarir) firm and one who guides others and is guided on the right path.\" So Jarir proceeded to it dismantled and burnt it, and then sent a messenger to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The messenger of Jarir said (to the Prophet), \"By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave that place till it was like a scabby camel.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times",
