He placed his hand in it and said, \"Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.\" I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":61,"hadith":88}}}
