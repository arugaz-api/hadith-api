    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:The Prophet (ﷺ) continued for such-and-such period imagining that he has slept (had sexual relations) with his wives, and in fact he did not. One day he said, to me, \"O `Aisha! Allah has instructed me regarding a matter about which I had asked Him. There came to me two men, one of them sat near my feet and the other near my head. The one near my feet, asked the one near my head (pointing at me), 'What is wrong with this man? The latter replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The first one asked, 'Who had worked magic on him?' The other replied, 'Lubaid bin Asam.' The first one asked, 'What material (did he use)?' The other replied, 'The skin of the pollen of a male date tree with a comb and the hair stuck to it, kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan.\"' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) went to that well and said, \"This is the same well which was shown to me in the dream. The tops of its date-palm trees look like the heads of the devils, and its water looks like the Henna infusion.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that those things be taken out. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Won't you disclose (the magic object)?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Allah has cured me and I hate to circulate the evil among the people.\" `Aisha added, \"(The magician) Lubaid bin Asam was a man from Bani Zuraiq, an ally of the Jews",
