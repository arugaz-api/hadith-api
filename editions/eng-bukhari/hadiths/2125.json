    "text": "Narrated Ata bin Yasar:I met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and asked him, \"Tell me about the description of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) which is mentioned in Torah (i.e. Old Testament.\") He replied, 'Yes. By Allah, he is described in Torah with some of the qualities attributed to him in the Qur'an as follows: \"O Prophet ! We have sent you as a witness (for Allah's True religion) And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), And a warner (to the unbelievers) And guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My messenger (i.e. Apostle). I have named you \"Al-Mutawakkil\" (who depends upon Allah). You are neither discourteous, harsh Nor a noisemaker in the markets And you do not do evil to those Who do evil to you, but you deal With them with forgiveness and kindness. Allah will not let him (the Prophet) Die till he makes straight the crooked people by making them say: \"None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,\" With which will be opened blind eyes And deaf ears and enveloped hearts",
