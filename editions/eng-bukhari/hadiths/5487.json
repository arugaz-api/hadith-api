    "text": "Narrated Adi Bin Hatim:I asked Allah's Messenger (ï·º), \"We hunt with these hounds.\" He said, \"If you send your trained hounds after a game and mention Allah's Name on sending, you can eat of what they catch for you. But if the hound eats of the game, then you must not eat of it, for I am afraid that the hound caught it for itself, and if another hound joins your hounds (during the hunt), you should not eat of the game",
