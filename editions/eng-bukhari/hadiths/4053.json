    "text": "Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:That his father was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud and was in debt and left six (orphan) daughters. Jabir, added, \"When the season of plucking the dates came, I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"You know that my father was martyred on the day of Uhud, and he was heavily in debt, and I would like that the creditors should see you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Go and pile every kind of dates apart.\" I did so and called him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ). When the creditors saw him, they started claiming their debts from me then in such a harsh manner (as they had never done before). So when he saw their attitude, he went round the biggest heap of dates thrice, and then sat over it and said, 'O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the creditors).' Then he kept on measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till Allah paid all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain nothing of those dates for my sisters after Allah had paid the debts of my father. But Allah saved all the heaps (of dates), so that when I looked at the heap where the Prophet (ﷺ) had been sitting, it seemed as if a single date had not been taken away thereof",
