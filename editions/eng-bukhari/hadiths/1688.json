    "text": "Narrated Abu Jamra:I asked Ibn `Abbas about Hajj-at-Tamattu`. He ordered me to perform it. I asked him about the Hadi (sacrifice). He said, \"You have to slaughter a camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hadi with the others.\" It seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu`). I slept and dreamt as if a person was announcing: \"Hajj Mabrur and accepted Mut'ah (Hajj-at-Tamattu`)\" I went to Ibn `Abbas and narrated it to him. He said, \"Allah is Greater. (That was) the tradition of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. Prophet). Narrated Shu`ba that the call in the dream was. \"An accepted `Umra and Hajj-Mabrur",
