{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":439,"arabicnumber":439,"text":"Narrated `Aisha:There was a black slave girl belonging to an 'Arab tribe and they manumitted her but she remained with them. The slave girl said, \"Once one of their girls (of that tribe) came out wearing a red leather scarf decorated with precious stones. It fell from her or she placed it somewhere. A kite passed by that place, saw it Lying there and mistaking it for a piece of meat, flew away with it. Those people searched for it but they did not find it. So they accused me of stealing it and started searching me and even searched my private parts.\" The slave girl further said, \"By Allah! while I was standing (in that state) with those people, the same kite passed by them and dropped the red scarf and it fell amongst them. I told them, 'This is what you accused me of and I was innocent and now this is it.' \" `Aisha added: That slave girl came to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and embraced Islam. She had a tent or a small room with a low roof in the mosque. Whenever she called on me, she had a talk with me and whenever she sat with me, she would recite the following: \"The day of the scarf (band) was one of the wonders of our Lord, verily He rescued me from the disbelievers' town. `Aisha added: \"Once I asked her, 'What is the matter with you? Whenever you sit with me, you always recite these poetic verses.' On that she told me the whole story","grades":[],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":88}}}
