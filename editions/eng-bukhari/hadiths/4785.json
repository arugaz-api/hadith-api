So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started with me, saying, \"I am going to mention to you something but you should not hasten (to give your reply) unless you consult your parents.' He knew that my parents would not order me to leave him. Then he said, \"Allah says:-- \"O Prophet! Say to your wives...\" (33.28-29) On that I said to him, \"Then why should I consult my parents? Verily, I seek Allah, His Apostle and the Home of the Hereafter",
