    "text": "Narrated Abu Dhar:I reached him (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) while in the shade of the Ka`ba; he was saying, \"They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka`ba! They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka`ba!\" I said (to myself ), \"What is wrong with me? Is anything improper detected in me? What is wrong with me? Then I sat beside him and he kept on saying his statement. I could not remain quiet, and Allah knows in what sorrowful state I was at that time. So I said, ' Who are they (the losers)? Let My father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"They are the wealthy people, except the one who does like this and like this and like this (i.e., spends of his wealth in Allah's Cause)",
