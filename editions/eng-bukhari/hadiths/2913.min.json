Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: That he participated in a Ghazwa (Holy-Battle) in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Midday came upon them while they were in a valley having many thorny trees. The people dispersed to rest in the shade of the trees. The Prophet (ﷺ) rested under a tree, hung his sword on it, and then slept. Then he woke up to find near to him, a man whose presence he had not noticed before. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This (man) took my sword (out of its scabbard) and said, 'Who will save you from me.' I replied, 'Allah.' So, he put the sword back into its scabbard, and you see him sitting here.\" Anyhow, the Prophet (ﷺ) did not punish him.
