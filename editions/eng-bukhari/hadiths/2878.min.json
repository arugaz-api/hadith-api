Invoke Allah to make me one of them.\" He said, \"O Allah! Let her be one of them.\" Then he (slept again and woke up and) smiled. She asked him the same question and he gave the same reply. She said, \"Invoke Allah to make me one of them.\" He replied, ''You will be amongst the first group of them; you will not be amongst the last.\" Later on she married 'Ubada bin As-Samit and then she sailed on the sea with bint Qaraza, Mu'awiya's wife (for Jihad).
