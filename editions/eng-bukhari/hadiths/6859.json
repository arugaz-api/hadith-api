So judge us according to Allah's Laws and please allow me (to speak), O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Speak.\" He said, \"My son was a laborer for the family of this man and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom (for my son), but I asked the religious learned people (regarding this case), and they informed me that my son should be flogged onehundred stripes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this man should be stoned (to death).\"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will Judge you (in this case) according to Allah's Laws. The one-hundred (sheep) and the slave shall be returned to you and your son shall be flogged one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And O Unais! Go in the morning to the wife of this man and ask her, and if she confesses, stone her to death.\" She confessed and he stoned her to death",
