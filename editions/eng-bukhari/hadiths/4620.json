    "text": "Narrated Anas:The alcoholic drink which was spilled was Al-Fadikh. I used to offer alcoholic drinks to the people at the residence of Abu Talha. Then the order of prohibiting Alcoholic drinks was revealed, and the Prophet ordered somebody to announce that: Abu Talha said to me, \"Go out and see what this voice (this announcement ) is.\" I went out and (on coming back) said, \"This is somebody announcing that alcoholic beverages have been prohibited.\" Abu Talha said to me, \"Go and spill it (i.e. the wine),\" Then it (alcoholic drinks) was seen flowing through the streets of Medina. At that time the wine was Al-Fadikh. The people said, \"Some people (Muslims) were killed (during the battle of Uhud) while wine was in their stomachs.\" So Allah revealed: \"On those who believe and do good deeds there is no blame for what they ate (in the past)",
