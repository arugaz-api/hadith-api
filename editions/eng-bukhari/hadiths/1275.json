    "text": "Narrated Ibrahim:Once a meal was brought to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and he was fasting. He said, \"Mustab bin `Umar was martyred and he was better than I and was shrouded in his Burd and when his head was covered with it, his legs became bare, and when his legs were covered his head got uncovered. Hamza was martyred and was better than I. Now the worldly wealth have been bestowed upon us (or said a similar thing). No doubt, I fear that the rewards of my deeds might have been given earlier in this world.\" Then he started weeping and left his food",
