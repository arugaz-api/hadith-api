    "text": "Narrated Usama bin Zaid:Allah's Messenger (ï·º) proceeded from `Arafat and dismounted at the mountainous pass and then urinated and performed a light ablution. I said to him, \"(Shall we offer) the prayer?\" He replied, \"The prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa).\" When he came to Al-Muzdalifa, he performed a perfect ablution. Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offered the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his camel kneel at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offered the (`Isha') prayer and he did not offer any prayer in between them (i.e. Maghrib and `Isha' prayers)",
