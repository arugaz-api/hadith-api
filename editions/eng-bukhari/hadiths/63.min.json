We replied, \"This white man reclining on his arm.\" The man then addressed him, \"O Son of `Abdul Muttalib.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I am here to answer your questions.\" The man said to the Prophet, \"I want to ask you something and will be hard in questioning. So do not get angry.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Ask whatever you want.\" The man said, \"I ask you by your Lord, and the Lord of those who were before you, has Allah sent you as an Apostle to all the mankind?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"By Allah, yes.\" The man further said, \"I ask you by Allah.
