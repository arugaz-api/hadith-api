{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":6363,"arabicnumber":6363,"text":"Narrated Anas bin Malik:The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Abu Talha, \"Choose one of your boys to serve me.\" So Abu Talha took me (to serve the Prophet (ﷺ) ) by giving me a ride behind him (on his camel). So I used to serve Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whenever he stayed somewhere. I used to hear him saying, \"O Allah! I seek refuge with you (Allah) from (worries) care and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other men.\" I kept on serving him till he returned from (the battle of) Khaibar. He then brought Safiya, the daughter of Huyay whom he had got (from the booty). I saw him making a kind of cushion with a cloak or a garment for her. He then let her ride behind him. When we reached a place called As-Sahba', he prepared (a special meal called) Hais, and asked me to invite the men who (came and) ate, and that was the marriage banquet given on the consummation of his marriage to her. Then he proceeded till the mountain of Uhud appeared, whereupon he said, \"This mountain loves us and we love it.\" When he approached Medina, he said, \"O Allah! I make the land between its (i.e., Medina's) two mountains a sanctuary, as the prophet Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (the people of Medina) in their Mudd and the Sa' (units of measuring)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":80,"hadith":60}}}
