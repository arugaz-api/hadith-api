{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4274,"arabicnumber":4274,"text":"Narrated `Ali:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent me, Az-Zubair and Al-Miqdad saying, \"Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh where there is a lady carrying a letter, and take that (letter) from her.\" So we proceeded on our way with our horses galloping till we reached the Rawda, and there we found the lady and said to her, \"Take out the letter.\" She said, \"I have no letter.\" We said, \"Take out the letter, or else we will take off your clothes.\" So she took it out of her braid, and we brought the letter to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . The letter was addressed from Hatib, bin Abi Balta'a to some pagans of Mecca, telling them about what Allah's Apostle intended to do. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Hatib! What is this?\" Hatib replied, \"O Allah's Apostle! Do not make a hasty decision about me. I was a person not belonging to Quraish but I was an ally to them from outside and had no blood relation with them, and all the Emigrants who were with you, have got their kinsmen (in Mecca) who can protect their families and properties. So I liked to do them a favor so that they might protect my relatives as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this to renegade from my religion (i.e. Islam) nor did I do it to choose Heathenism after Islam.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to his companions.\" As regards him, he (i.e. Hatib) has told you the truth.\" `Umar said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"He (i.e. Hatib) has witnessed the Badr battle (i.e. fought in it) and what could tell you, perhaps Allah looked at those who witnessed Badr and said, \"O the people of Badr (i.e. Badr Muslim warriors), do what you like, for I have forgiven you. \"Then Allah revealed the Sura:-- \"O you who believe! Take not my enemies And your enemies as friends offering them (Your) love even though they have disbelieved in that Truth (i.e. Allah, Prophet Muhammad and this Qur'an) which has come to you ....(to the end of Verse)....(And whosoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed he has gone (far) astray (away) from the Straight Path","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":308}}}
