When the Verse:--\"By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.\" (3.92) Abu Talha got up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), Allah says:--\"By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.\" (3.92) and the most beloved of my property to me is the Bairuha garden, so I give it (as a charitable gift) in Allah's Cause and hope to receive good out of it, and to have it stored for me with Allah. So, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Dispose it of (i.e. utilize it) in the way Allah orders you (to dispose it of).\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Bravo! That is a fruitful property! That is a fruitful property! I have heard what you have said and I think that you should distribute that (garden) amongst your relatives.\" The Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins.
