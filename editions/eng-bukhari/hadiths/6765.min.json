Sa`d said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This (boy) is the son of my brother, `Utba bin Abi Waqqas who told me to be his custodian as he was his son. Please notice to whom he bears affinity.\" And 'Abu bin Zam`a said, \"This is my brother, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He was born on my father's bed by his slave girl.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) looked at the boy and noticed evident resemblance between him and `Utba, so he said, \"He (the toy) is for you, O 'Abu bin Zam`a, for the boy is for the owner of the bed, and the stone is for the adulterer. Screen yourself before the boy, O Sauda bint Zam`a.\" `Aisha added: Since then he had never seen Sauda","grades":[],"reference":{"book":85,"hadith":42}}}
