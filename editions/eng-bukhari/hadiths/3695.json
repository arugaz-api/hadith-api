The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.\" Behold! It was Abu Bakr. Another man came and asked the permission to enter. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.\" Behold! It was `Umar. Then another man came, asking the permission to enter. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept silent for a short while and then said, \"Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.\" Behold! It was `Uthman bin `Affan. `Asim, in another narration, said that the Prophet (ﷺ) was sitting in a place where there was water, and he was uncovering both his knees or his knee, and when `Uthman entered, he covered them (or it)",
