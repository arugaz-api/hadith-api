The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Abu Dhar! I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole amount) among Allah's slaves like this and like this and like this.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, \"O Abu Dhar!\" I replied, \"Labbaik wa Sa`daik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"Those who have much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity).\" Then he ordered me, \"Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back.\" He went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something might have happened to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and I intended to go (to find out) but I remembered the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that I should not leave, my place, so I kept on waiting (and after a while the Prophet (ﷺ) came), and I said to him, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"That was Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without joining others in worship with Allah, would enter Paradise.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft?\" He said, \"Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft","grades":[],"reference":{"book":79,"hadith":42}}}
