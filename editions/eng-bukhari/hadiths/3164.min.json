I counted it and it was five-hundred (gold pieces). The total amount he gave me was one thousand and five hundred (gold pieces.) Narrated Anas: Money from Bahrain was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) . He said, \"Spread it in the Mosque.\" It was the biggest amount that had ever been brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . In the meantime Al-`Abbas came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Give me, for I gave the ransom of myself and `Aqil.\" The Prophet said (to him), \"Take.\" He scooped money with both hands and poured it in his garment and tried to lift it, but he could not and appealed to the Prophet, \"Will you order someone to help me in lifting it?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"No.\" Then Al-`Abbas said, \"Then will you yourself help me carry it?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"No.\" Then Al `Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was not able to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet (ﷺ) \"Will you order someone to help me carry it?\" The Prophet said, \"No.\" Then Al-`Abbas said, \"Then will you yourself yelp me carry it?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'No.\" So, Al-`Abbas threw away some more money and lifted it on his shoulder and went away.
