{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4102,"arabicnumber":4102,"text":"Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:When the Trench was dug, I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) in the state of severe hunger. So I returned to my wife and said, \"Have you got anything (to eat), for I have seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in a state of severe hunger.\" She brought out for me, a bag containing one Sa of barley, and we had a domestic she animal (i.e. a kid) which I slaughtered then, and my wife ground the barley and she finished at the time I finished my job (i.e. slaughtering the kid). Then I cut the meat into pieces and put it in an earthenware (cooking) pot, and returned to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . My wife said, \"Do not disgrace me in front of Allah's Apostle and those who are with him.\" So I went to him and said to him secretly, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have slaughtered a she-animal (i.e. kid) of ours, and we have ground a Sa of barley which was with us. So please come, you and another person along with you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) raised his voice and said, \"O people of Trench ! Jabir has prepared a meal so let us go.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, \"Don't put down your earthenware meat pot (from the fireplace) or bake your dough till I come.\" So I came (to my house) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) too, came, proceeding before the people. When I came to my wife, she said, \"May Allah do so-and-so to you.\" I said, \"I have told the Prophet (ﷺ) of what you said.\" Then she brought out to him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) the dough, and he spat in it and invoked for Allah's Blessings in it. Then he proceeded towards our earthenware meat-pot and spat in it and invoked for Allah's Blessings in it. Then he said (to my wife). Call a lady-baker to bake along with you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and do not put it down from its fireplace.\" They were onethousand (who took their meals), and by Allah they all ate, and when they left the food and went away, our earthenware pot was still bubbling (full of meat) as if it had not decreased, and our dough was still being baked as if nothing had been taken from it","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":146}}}
