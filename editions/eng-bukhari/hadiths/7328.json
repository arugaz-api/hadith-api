    "text": "Narrated Hisham's father:`Aisha said to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, \"Bury me with my female companions (i.e. the wives of the Prophet) and do not bury me with the Prophet (ﷺ) in the house, for I do not like to be regarded as sanctified (just for being buried there).'' Narrated Hisham's father: `Umar sent a message to `Aisha, saying, \"Will you allow me to be buried with my two companions (the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr) ?\" She said, \"Yes, by Allah.\" though it was her habit that if a man from among the companions (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) sent her a message asking her to allow him to be buried there, she would say, \"No, by Allah, I will never give permission to anyone to be buried with them",
