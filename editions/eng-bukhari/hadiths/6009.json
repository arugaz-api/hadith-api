Then he came across a well, got down into it, drank (of its water) and then came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud because of excessive thirst. The man said to himself \"This dog is suffering from the same state of thirst as I did.\" So he went down the well (again) and filled his shoe (with water) and held it in his mouth and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him.\" The people asked, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!
