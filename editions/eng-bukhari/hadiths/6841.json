    "text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:The jews came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned to him that a man and a lady among them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them, \"What do you find in the Torah regarding the Rajam?\" They replied, \"We only disgrace and flog them with stripes.\" `Abdullah bin Salam said to them, 'You have told a lie the penalty of Rajam is in the Torah.' They brought the Torah and opened it. One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before and after it. `Abdullah bin Salam said to him, \"Lift up your hand.\" Where he lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, \"O Muhammad! He has said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death, and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her from the stones",
