Protect me against their evil by afflicting them with seven (years of famine) like the seven years of (Prophet) Joseph.\" So they were struck with a year of famine that destroyed everything till they had to eat bones, and till a man would look towards the sky and see something like smoke between him and it. Allah said:-- \"Then watch you (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce a kind of smoke plainly visible.\" (44.10) And Allah further said:-- \"Verily! We shall withdraw the punishment a little, Verily you will return (to disbelief).\" (44.15) (Will Allah relieve them from torture on the Day of Resurrection?) (The punishment of) the smoke had passed and Al-Baltsha (the destruction of the pagans in the Badr battle) had passed too","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":215}}}
