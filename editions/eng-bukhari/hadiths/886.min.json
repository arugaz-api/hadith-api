On that `Umar said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You have given me this cloak although on the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was selling that silken cloak at the gate of the mosque) you passed such and such a remark.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"I have not given you this to wear\". And so `Umar bin Al-Khattab gave it to his pagan brother in Mecca to wear","grades":[],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":11}}}
