So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, \"You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you.\" I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping.

Who is my father?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"Your father is Hudhaifa.\" Then `Umar got up and said, \"We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \" I have never seen the good and bad like on this day.
