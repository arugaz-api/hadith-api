{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":86,"arabicnumber":86,"text":"Narrated Asma':I came to `Aisha while she was praying, and said to her, \"What has happened to the people?\" She pointed out towards the sky. (I looked towards the mosque), and saw the people offering the prayer. Aisha said, \"Subhan Allah.\" I said to her, \"Is there a sign?\" She nodded with her head meaning, \"Yes.\" I, too, then stood (for the prayer of eclipse) till I became (nearly) unconscious and later on I poured water on my head. After the prayer, the Prophet (ﷺ) praised and glorified Allah and then said, \"Just now at this place I have seen what I have never seen before, including Paradise and Hell. No doubt it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be like the trials of Masih-ad-Dajjal or nearly like it (the sub narrator is not sure which expression Asma' used). You will be asked, 'What do you know about this man (the Prophet (ﷺ) Muhammad)?' Then the faithful believer (or Asma' said a similar word) will reply, 'He is Muhammad Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who had come to us with clear evidences and guidance and so we accepted his teachings and followed him. And he is Muhammad.' And he will repeat it thrice. Then the angels will say to him, 'Sleep in peace as we have come to know that you were a faithful believer.' On the other hand, a hypocrite or a doubtful person will reply, 'I do not know, but I heard the people saying something and so I said it.' (the same)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":28}}}
