The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Um Salama, \"(Do you know) who it was?\" (or a similar question). She said, \"It was Dihya (a handsome person amongst the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) ).\" Later on Um Salama said, \"By Allah! I thought he was none but Dihya, till I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) talking about Gabriel in his sermon.\" (The Sub-narrator asked Abu `Uthman, \"From where have you heard this narration?\" He replied, \"From Usama bin Zaid)",
