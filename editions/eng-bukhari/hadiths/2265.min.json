Then I had an employee, who quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit and cut the other's finger and caused his own tooth to fall out. He then went to the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet (ﷺ) canceled the suit and said to the complainant, \"Did you expect him to let his finger in your mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?\" Narrated Ibn Juraij from `Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from his grandfather a similar story: A man bit the hand of another man and caused his own tooth to fall out, but Abu Bakr judged that he had no right for compensation (for the broken tooth)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}}
