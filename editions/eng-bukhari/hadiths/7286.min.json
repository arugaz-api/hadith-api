'Uyaina said to his nephew, \"O my nephew! Have you an approach to this chief so as to get for me the permission to see him?\" His nephew said, \"I will get the permission for you to see him.\" (Ibn `Abbas added: ) So he took the permission for 'Uyaina, and when the latter entered, he said, \"O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.\" On that `Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him. Al-Hurr, said, \"O Chief of the Believers!\" Allah said to His Apostle 'Hold to forgiveness, command what is good (right), and leave the foolish (i.e. do not punish them).'
