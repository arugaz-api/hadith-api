    "text": "Narrated Ibn `Umar:`Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told them, \"We will let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish.\" So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on living there until `Umar forced them to go towards Taima' and Ariha",
