    "text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr:The news of my fasting was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ) . So he entered upon me and I put for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm-fibres. The Prophet (ﷺ) sat on the floor and the cushion was between me and him. He said to me, \"Isn't it sufficient for you (that you fast) three days a month?\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more than this).\" He said, \"You may fast) five days a month.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (I can fast more than this).\" He said, \"(You may fast) seven days.\" I said, \"O Allah's Apostle!\" He said, \"Nine.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"Eleven.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"No fasting is superior to the fasting of (the Prophet (ﷺ) David) which was one half of a year, and he used, to fast on alternate days.
