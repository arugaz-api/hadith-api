    "text": "Narrated `Aisha:Fatima and Al `Abbas came to Abu Bakr, seeking their share from the property of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and at that time, they were asking for their land at Fadak and their share from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said to them, \" I have heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'Our property cannot be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity, but the family of Muhammad may take their provisions from this property.\" Abu Bakr added, \"By Allah, I will not leave the procedure I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) following during his lifetime concerning this property.\" Therefore Fatima left Abu Bakr and did not speak to him till she died",
