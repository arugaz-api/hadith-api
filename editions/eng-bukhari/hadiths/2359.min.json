The Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, \"Let the water pass' but Az-Zubair refused to do so. So, the case was brought before the Prophet (ﷺ) who said to Az-Zubair, \"O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then let the water pass to your neighbor.\" On that the Ansari got angry and said to the Prophet, \"Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your aunt's son?\" On that the color of the face of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) changed (because of anger) and he said, \"O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees.\" Zubair said, \"By Allah, I think that the following verse was revealed on this occasion\": \"But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them","grades":[],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":8}}}
