{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1559,"arabicnumber":1559,"text":"Narrated Abu Musa:The Prophet (ﷺ) sent me to some people in Yemen and when I returned, I found him at Al-Batha. He asked me, \"With what intention have you assumed Ihram (i.e. for Hajj or for Umra or for both?\") I replied, \"I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of the Prophet.\" He asked, \"Have you a Hadi with you?\" I replied in the negative. He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when `Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, \"If we follow Allah's Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: \"Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah.\" (2.196). And if we follow the tradition of the Prophet (ﷺ) who did not finish his Ihram till he sacrificed his Hadi","grades":[],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":45}}}
