I mentioned the narration of `Abdullah bin `Utba regarding the question of Subai'a bint Al-Harith. `Abdur-Rahman said, \"But `Abdullah's uncle used not to say so.\" I said, \"I am too brave if I tell a lie concerning a person who is now in Al-Kufa,\" and I raised my voice. Then I went out and met Malik bin 'Amir or Malik bin `Auf, and said, \"What was the verdict of Ibn Mas`ud about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?\" He replied, \"Ibn Mas`ud said, 'Why do you impose on her the hard order and don't let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women (i.e. Surat-at- Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. Surat-al-Baqara).\" (i.e. Her 'Idda is up till she delivers)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":55}}}
