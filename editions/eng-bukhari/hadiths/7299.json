    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to his companions), \"Do not fast Al-Wisal.\" They said, \"But you fast Al-Wisail.\" He said, \"I am not like you, for at night my Lord feeds me and makes me drink.\" But the people did not give up Al-Wisal, so the Prophet (ﷺ) fasted Al-Wisal with them for two days or two nights, and then they saw the crescent whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If the crescent had delayed, I would have continued fasting (because of you),\" as if he wanted to vanquish them completely (because they had refused to give up Al Wisal)",
