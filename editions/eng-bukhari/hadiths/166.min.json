{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":166,"arabicnumber":166,"text":"Narrated `Ubaid Ibn Juraij:I asked `Abdullah bin `Umar, \"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! I saw you doing four things which I never saw being done by anyone of you companions?\" `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"What are those, O Ibn Juraij?\" I said, \"I never saw you touching any corner of the Ka`ba except these (two) facing south (Yemen) and I saw you wearing shoes made of tanned leather and dyeing your hair with Hinna (a kind of red dye). I also noticed that whenever you were in Mecca, the people assume Ihram on seeing the new moon crescent (1st of Dhul-Hijja) while you did not assume the Ihlal (Ihram) -(Ihram is also called Ihlal which means 'Loud calling' because a Muhrim has to recite Talbiya aloud when assuming the state of Ihram) - till the 8th of Dhul-Hijja (Day of Tarwiya). `Abdullah replied, \"Regarding the corners of Ka`ba, I never saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) touching except those facing south (Yemen) and regarding the tanned leather shoes, no doubt I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wearing non-hairy shoes and he used to perform ablution while wearing the shoes (i.e. wash his feet and then put on the shoes). So I love to wear similar shoes. And about the dyeing of hair with Hinna; no doubt I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) dyeing his hair with it and that is why I like to dye (my hair with it). Regarding Ihlal, I did not see Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) assuming Ihlal till he set out for Hajj (on the 8th of Dhul-Hijja)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":32}}}
