{"author":"Sahih al Bukhari","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1560,"arabicnumber":1560,"text":"Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:' Aisha said, \"We set out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet (ﷺ) then addressed his companions and said, \"Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu`) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing ' `Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, \"The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me and saw me weeping and said, \"What makes you weep, O Hantah?\" I replied, \"I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.\" He asked, \"What is wrong with you?' I replied, ' I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).' He said, ' It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.\" Aisha further added, \"Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka`ba.\" Aisha added, \"I went along with the Prophet (ﷺ) in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.\" He called ' `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, ' Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for ' `Umra, and when you had finished ' `Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.' \" ' Aisha added, \" So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the ' `Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet (ﷺ) at dawn. He said, 'Have you performed the ' `Umra?' We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina","grades":[],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":46}}}
