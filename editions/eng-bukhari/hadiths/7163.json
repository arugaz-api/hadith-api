    "text": "Narrated 'Abdullah bin As-Sa'di: That when he went to 'Umar during his Caliphate. 'Umar said to him, \"Haven't I been told that you do certain jobs for the people but when you are given payment you refuse to take it?\" 'Abdullah added: I said, \"Yes.\" 'Umar said, \"Why do you do so?\" I said, \"I have horses and slaves and I am living in prosperity and I wish that my payment should be kept as a charitable gift for the Muslims.\" 'Umar said, \"Do not do so, for I intended to do the same as you do. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s used to give me gifts and I used to say to him, 'Give it to a more needy one than me.' Once he gave me some money and I said, 'Give it to a more needy person than me,' whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Take it and keep it in your possession and then give it in charity. Take what ever comes to you of this money if you are not keen to have it and not asking for it; otherwise (i.e., if it does not come to you) do not seek to have it yourself",
