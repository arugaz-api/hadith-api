    "text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed one of the `Isha' prayer in his last days and after finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, \"Do you realize (the importance of) this night? Nobody present on the surface of the earth tonight would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night.\" The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and they indulged in those things which are said about these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Nobody present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of 100 years from this night\"; he meant \"When that century (people of that century) would pass away",
