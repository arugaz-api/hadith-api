    "text": "Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr:The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet (ﷺ) once said, \"Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or said something similar).\" Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet (ﷺ) took ten. And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the sub-narrator is in doubt whether `Abdur-Rahman said, \"My wife and my servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr's house.\") Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet (ﷺ) and stayed there till he offered the `Isha' prayers. He returned and stayed till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his house. His wife said to him, \"What has detained you from your guests?\" He said, \"Have you served supper to them?\" She said, \"They refused to take supper until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but they refused (to eat)\" I went to hide myself and he said, \"O Ghunthar!\" He invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please eat!\" and added, I will never eat the meal.\" By Allah, whenever we took a handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife, \"O sister of Bani Firas!\" She said, \"O pleasure of my eyes. The food has been tripled in quantity.\" Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, \"It (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.\" He took a handful from it, and carried the rest to the Prophet. So that food was with the Prophet (ﷺ) . There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet (ﷺ) surely sent a leader with each group. Then all of them ate of that meal",
