    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira:I said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \"I hear many narrations (Hadiths) from you but I forget them.\" Allah's Apostle said, \"Spread your Rida' (garment).\" I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if filling them with something (and emptied them in my Rida') and then said, \"Take and wrap this sheet over your body.\" I did it and after that I never forgot any thing. Narrated Ibrahim bin Al-Mundhir: Ibn Abi Fudaik narrated the same as above (Hadith...119) but added that the Prophet (ﷺ) had moved his hands as if filling them with something and then he emptied them in the Rida' of Abu Huraira",
