They fastened him to one of the pillars of the Mosque. The Prophet went to him and said, \"What have you got, O Thumama?\" He replied,\" I have got a good thought, O Muhammad! If you should kill me, you would kill a person who has already killed somebody, and if you should set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful, and if you want property, then ask me whatever wealth you want.\" He was left till the next day when the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, \"What have you got, Thumama? He said, \"What I told you, i.e. if you set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) left him till the day after, when he said, \"What have you got, O Thumama?\" He said, \"I have got what I told you. \"On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Release Thumama.\" So he (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and then entered the Mosque and said, \"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and also testify that Muhammad is His Apostle! By Allah, O Muhammad! There was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face has become the most beloved face to me. By Allah, there was no religion most disliked by me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no town most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the `Umra. And now what do you think?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him to perform the `Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, \"You have become a Sabian?\" Thumama replied, \"No! By Allah, I have embraced Islam with Muhammad, Apostle of Allah. No, by Allah! Not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Yamamah unless the Prophet gives his permission","grades":[],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":398}}}
