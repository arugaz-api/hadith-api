    "text": "Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:A bedouin came and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Judge between us according to Allah's Book (Laws).\" His opponent stood up and said, \"He has said the truth, so judge between us according to Allah's Laws.\" The bedouin said, \"My son was a laborer for this man and committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people said to me, 'Your son is to be stoned to death,' so I ransomed my son for one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious learned men and they said to me, 'Your son has to receive one hundred lashes plus one year of exile.' \" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I shall judge between you according to Allah's Book (Laws)! As for the slave girl and the sheep, it shall be returned to you, and your son shall receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O you, Unais!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed some man, \"Go in the morning to the wife of this man and stone her to death.\" So Unais went to her the next morning and stoned her to death",
