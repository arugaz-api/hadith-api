So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) went round one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat on it and said, \"Measure (for them).\" He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as had been paid to them",
