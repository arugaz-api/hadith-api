    "text": "Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:Sa`d bin Mu`adh came to Mecca with the intention of performing `Umra, and stayed at the house of Umaiya bin Khalaf Abi Safwan, for Umaiya himself used to stay at Sa`d's house when he passed by Medina on his way to Sham. Umaiya said to Sa`d, \"Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka`ba?\" So, while Sa`d was going around the Ka`ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, \"Who is that who is performing Tawaf?\" Sa`d replied, \"I am Sa`d.\" Abu Jahl said, \"Are you circumambulating the Ka`ba safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?\" Sa`d said, \"Yes,\" and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sa`d, \"Don't shout at Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).\" Sa`d then said (to Abu Jahl). 'By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka`ba, I will spoil your trade with Sham.\" Umaiya kept on saying to Sa`d, \"Don't raise your voice.\" and kept on taking hold of him. Sa`d became furious and said, (to Umaiya), \"Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill you.\" Umaiiya said, \"Will he kill me?\" Sa`d said, \"Yes,.\" Umaiya said, \"By Allah! When Muhammad says a thing, he never tells a lie.\" Umaiya went to his wife and said to her, \"Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has said to me?\" She said, \"What has he said?\" He said, \"He claims that he has heard Muhammad claiming that he will kill me.\" She said, By Allah! Muhammad never tells a lie.\" So when the infidels started to proceed for Badr (Battle) and declared war (against the Muslims), his wife said to him, \"Don't you remember what your brother from Yathrib told you?\" Umaiya decided not to go but Abu Jahl said to him, \"You are from the nobles of the valley (of Mecca), so you should accompany us for a day or two.\" He went with them and thus Allah got him killed",
