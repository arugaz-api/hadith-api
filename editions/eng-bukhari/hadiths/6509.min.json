I said' \"Hence he is not going to choose us.\" And I came to know that it was the application of the narration which he (the Prophet) used to narrate to us. And that was the last statement of the Prophet (before his death) i.e., \"O Allah! With the highest companions.\" (See Qur'an 4:)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":81,"hadith":98}}}
