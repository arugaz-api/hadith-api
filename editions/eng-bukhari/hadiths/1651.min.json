They (the people) said, \"How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?\" When that news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he said, \"If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram.\" `Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka`ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba. She said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and `Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan`im and thus she performed the `Umra after the Hajj","grades":[],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":132}}}
