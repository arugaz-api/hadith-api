Marwan sent some domestic goods for decoration to Umm Darda' on his own behalf, and when it was night 'Abd al-Malik got up and called for the servant. It seemed as if he (the servant) was late (in responding to his call), so he ('Abd al-Malik) invoked curse upon him, and when it was morning Umm Darda' said to him:I heard you cursing your servant during the night when you called him, and she said: I heard Abu Darda' as saying that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said: The invoker of curse would neither be intercessor nor witness on the Day of Resurrection",
