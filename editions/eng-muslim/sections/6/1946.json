    "text": "Jabir reported:We fought In the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with the tribe of Juhaina. They fought with us terribly. When we had finished the noon prayer, the polytheists said: Had we attacked them at once. we would have killed them. Gabriel informed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about It (about their evil design). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a mention of it to us, adding that they (the polytheists) had also said: Shortly there would be time for the 'Asr prayer. which is dearer o them (the Muslims) than even their children. So when the time of the 'Asr prayer came. we formed ourselves into two rows, while the polytheists were between us and the Qibla. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah is Most Great, and we also said so. He bowed and we also bowed. He went down in prostration and the first row prostrated along with him. When they stood up, the second row went down in prostration. Then the first row went into the rear, and the second row came in the front and occupied the place of the first row. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said: Allah is Most Great, and we also said so. He then bowed, and we also bowed. He then went down in prostration and along with him the row also (went down in prostration), and the second row remained standing. And when the second row had also prostrated and all of them sat down then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pronounced salutation to them. Abu Zubair said: Jabir made a mention specially of this thing: just as your chiefs observe prayer",
