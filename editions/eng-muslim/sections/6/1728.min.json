'A'isha, did not say\" he stood up\" ), and poured water over him (by Allah she, i. e. 'A'isha, did not say that he took a bath but I know what she meant) and if he did not have an intercourse, he performed ablution, just as a man performs ablution for prayer and then observed two rak'ahs","grades":[],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":157}}}
