    "text": "Ibn 'Abbas reported that while Gabriel was sitting with the Apostle (ï·º) he heard a creaking sound above him. He lifted his head and said:This is a gate opened in heaven today which had never been opened before. Then when an angel descended through it, he said: This is an angel who came down to the earth who had never come down before. He greeted and said: Rejoice in two lights given to you which have not been given to any prophet before you: Fatihat al-Kitab and the concluding verses of Surah al-Baqara. You will never recite a letter from them for which you will not be given (a reward)",
