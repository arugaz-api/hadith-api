Sam'an said he heard the Apostle (ﷺ) say:On the Day of Resurrection the Qur'an and those who acted according to it will be brought with Surah al-Baqara and AI 'Imran preceding them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) likened them to three things, which I did not forget afterwards. He (the Holy Prophet) likened them to two clouds, or two black canopies with light between them, or like two flocks of birds in ranks pleading for one who recited them",
