    "text": "Sa'id b. Jubair reported that. a near one of 'Abdullah b. Mughaffal threw pebbles. He prohibited him (to do so). He said that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) had prohibited the throwing of pebbles by saying:It does not catch the game, nor does it inflict defeat on the enemy, but breaks the tooth and puts the eye out. He (the near one of Abdullah b. Mughadal) again repeated it (the act of throwing of pebbles) whereupon he said: I narrate to you that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon hish) disliked and prohibited throwing of pebbles, but I see you again throwing pebbles; I (would therefore) not speak with you",
