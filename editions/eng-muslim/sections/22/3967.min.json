The jews asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to let them continue there on the condition that they would work on it, and would get in turn half of the fruit (of the trees), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:We would let you continue there so long as we will desire. So they continued (to cultivate the lands) till 'Umar externed them to Taima' ang Ariha (two villages in Arabia, but out of Hijaz)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":6}}}
