He said:Leave it and take off your claim from it, for I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) as saying: He who took a span of land without his right would be made to wear around his neck seven earths on the Day of Resurrection. He (Sa'id b. Zaid) said: O Allah, make her blind if she has told a lie and make her grave in her house. He (the narrator) said: I saw her blind groping (her way) by touching the walls and saying: The curse of Sa'id b. Zaid has hit me. And it so happened that as she was walking in her house, she passed by a well in her house and fell therein and that be- came her grave",
