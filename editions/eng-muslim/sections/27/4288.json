    "text": "Abu Huraira reported that Sulaiman b. Dawud said:I will certainly have intercourse with seventy wives during the night, and every wife amongst them will give birth to a child, who will fight in the cause of Allah. It was said to him: Say:\" Insha' Allah\" (God willing), but he did not say so and forgot it. He went round them but none of them give birth to a child except one woman and that too was an incomplete person. Upon this Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said: If he had said\" Insha' Allah.\" he would not have failed, and his desire must have been fulfilled",
