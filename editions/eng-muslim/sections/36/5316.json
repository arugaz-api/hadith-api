    "text": "Anas b. Malik reported that Abu Talha said to Umm Sulaim:I felt some feebleness in the voice of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and perceived that it was due to hunger; so have you anything with you? She said: Yes. She brought out barley loaves, then took out a head-covering of hers, in a part of which she wrapped those loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it. She then sent me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I set forth and found Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sitting in the mosque in the company of some persons. I stood near them, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Has Abu Talha sent you? I said, Yes. He said: Is it for a feast? I said. Yes. Thereupon Allah's messenger (ﷺ) said to'those who were with him to get up He went forth and so I did before them, until I came to Abu Talha and informed him. Abu Talba said: Umm Sulaim, here comes Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with people and we do not have enough (food) to feed them. She said: Allah and His Messenger know best. Abu Talha went out (to receive him) Until he met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came forward along with him until they both (Allah's Messenger, along with Abu Talha) came in. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Umm Sulaim. bring forth that which you have with you. She brought the bread. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that the bread be broken into small pieces, and when Umm Sulaim had squeezed a small waterskin and put seasoning on it, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited something regarding it what Allah wished him to say. He then said: Allow ten (guests to come in and have their meals). He permitted them; they ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (the Holy Prophet) again said: Permit ten (more) and he (the host gave permission to them. They ate until they had enough. Then they went out. he again said: Permit ten (more) until all the people had eaten to their fill, and they were seventy or eighty persons",
