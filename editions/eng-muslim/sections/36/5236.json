She came and stayed in the fortresses of Banu Sa'idah. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out until he came to her while she was (at that time) sitting with her head downcast. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) talked to her, she said: I seek refuge with Allah from you. Thereupon he said: I (have decided to) keep you away from me. They (the people near her) said: Do you know who he is? She said: No. They said: He is the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He came to you in order to give you the proposal of marriage. She said: Then I am the most unfortunate woman because of this (i. e. my defiance). Sahl said: Allah's. Messenger (ﷺ) then set forth on that day until he sat in the Saqifa of Banu Sa'idah along with his Companions. He then said to Sahl: Serve us drink. He (Sahl) said: I brought out for them this bowl (containing drink) and served them this. Abu Hazim said: Sahl brought out this cup for us and we also drank from that. Then 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz asked him to give that (cup) as a gift to him and he gave (it to) him as a gift. In the narration of Abu Bakr b. Ishaq (the words) are:\" Sahl, serve us drink",
