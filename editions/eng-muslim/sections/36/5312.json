He (Allah's Messenger) said, \"and her too,\" referring to `Aisha. The man said \"No,\" so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said \"No.\" He returned later to invite him again, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said \"and her too.\" The man said \"No,\" so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said \"No.\" He returned another time to invite him and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"and her too.\" The man said yes on this third occasion, and they then stood eagerly to go out together to the man's home",
