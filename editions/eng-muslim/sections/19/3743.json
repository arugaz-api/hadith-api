Tell me about a person who finds a man with his wife; should he kill him, and be killed In retaliation; or how should he act? 'Asim, ask for me (religious verdict about it) from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So 'Asim asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he did not like this question and he disapproved of it so much that'Asim felt aggrieved at what he had heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When 'Asim came back to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said:'Asim, what did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say to you? 'Asim said to 'Uwaimir: You did not bring something good. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not like this religious verdict that I sought from him. 'Uwaimir said: By Allah, I will not rest until I have asked him about it. 'Uwaimir proceeded until he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he was sitting amidst people, and said: Messenger of Allah, tell me about a person who found a man with his wife. Should he kill him, and then you would kill him, or how should he act? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: (Verses) have been revealed concerning you and your wife; so go and bring her. Sahl said that they both invoked curses (and further said): I was along with people in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And when they had finished, Uwaimir said: Allah's Messenger, I shall have told a lie against her if I keep her (now). So he divorced her with three pronouncements before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had commanded him. Ibn Shihab said: Subsequently that was the practice of invokers of curses (al Mutala'inain)",
