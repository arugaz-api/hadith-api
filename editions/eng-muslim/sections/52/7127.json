    "text": "Shaqiq reported:We were sitting at the door of Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) waiting for him (to come out and deliver a sermon to us). It was at this time that there happened to pass by us Yazid b. Mu'awiya an-Nakha'i. We said: Inform him ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) of our presence here. He went in and Abdullah b. Mas'ud lost no time in coming out to us and said: I was informed of your presence here but nothing hindered me to come out to you but the fact that I did not like to bore you (by stuffing your minds with sermons) as Allah's Messenger (ï·º) did not deliver us sermon on certain days fearing that it might prove to be boring for us",
