    "text": "Khabbab reported that Al-`As b. Wa'il owed debt to me. I came to him in order to demand that. He said:I will never repay you unless you belie Muhammad. I said: I would never belie Muhammad until you die and you are again raised up. He said: When I would be raised up after death, I would repay your debt when I would get my property and children back. Waki` said: This is how Al-A`mash has narrated and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed: \"Hast thou seen him who disbelieves in Our message and says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children\" (xix, 77) up to \"he would come to Us alone\" (xix)",
