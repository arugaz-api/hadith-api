Shihab reported that a Jew said to 'Umar:If this verse were revealed in relation to the Jews (i e. \"This day I have perfected your religion for you and have completed My favours for you and have chosen for you al-Islam as religion\") we would have taken the day of rejoicing on which this verse was revealed. Thereupon 'Umar said: I know the day on which it was revealed and the hour when it was revealed and where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been when it was revealed. It was revealed on the night of Friday and we were in 'Arafat with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at that time",
