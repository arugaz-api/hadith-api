    "text": "Ibn Abbas reported that some Muslims met a person with a small flock of sheep. He said:As-Salam-o-'Alaikum. They caught hold of him and killed him and took possession of his flock. Then this verse was revealed:\" He who meets you and extends you salutations, don't say: You are not a Muslim\" (iv. 94). Ibn 'Abbas, however, recited the word as-Salam instead of\" as-Salam",
