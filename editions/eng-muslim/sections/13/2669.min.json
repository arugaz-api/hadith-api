'Afra' said that the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) sent (a person) on the morning of Ashura to the villages of Ansar around Medina (with this message):He who got up in the morning fasting (without eating anything) he should complete his fast, and he who had had his breakfast in the morning, he should complete the rest of the day (without food). The Companions said; We henceforth observed fast on it (on the day of 'Ashura) and, God willing, made our children observe that.
