We (all) ate until we were fully satisfied and then filled our bags with provisions. Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Is there any water for performing ablution. Then there came a man with a small bucket containing some water. He threw it in a basin. We all fourteen hundred persons performed ablution using the water in plenty. Then there came after that eight persons and they said: Is there any water to perform ablution? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The ablution has already been performed",
