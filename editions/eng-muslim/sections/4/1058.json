    "text": "Hakam reported:There dominated in Kufa a man whose name was men- tioned as Zaman b. al-Ash'ath, who ordered Abu 'Ubaidah b. 'Abdullah to lead people in prayer and he accordingly used to lead them.

'Azib say that the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) and his bowing, and when he lifted his head from bowing, and his prostration, and between the two prostrations (all these acts) were nearly proportionate.
