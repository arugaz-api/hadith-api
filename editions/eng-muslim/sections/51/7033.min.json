It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:\" Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for them is a painful chastisement\" (iii)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":10}}}
