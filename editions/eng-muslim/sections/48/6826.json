    "text": "Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:He who loves meeting Allah, Allah loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah, Allah abhors to meet him. I (Shuraih b. Hani, one of the narrators) came to A'isha and said to her: Mother of the faithful, I heard Abu Huraira narrate from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which, if it is actually so, is a destruction to us. Thereupon she said: Those are in fact ruined who are ruined at the words of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). What are (the words which in your opinion would cause your destruction)? He said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had stated: He who loves to meet Allah, Allah too loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah, Allah too abhors to meet him, and there is none amongst us who dons not hate death. Thereupon she said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has in fact stated this, but it does not mean what you construe, but it implies (the time) when one loses the lustre of the eye, and there is rattling in the throat, shudder in the body and convulsion in fingers (at the time of death). (It is about this time) that it has been said: He who loves to meet Allah, Allah would love to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah, Allah would abhor to meet him",
