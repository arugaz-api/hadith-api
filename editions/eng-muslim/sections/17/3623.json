'Abd al-Rahman reported that when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) married Umm Salama and he visited her, and when he intended to come out, she caught hold of his cloth. whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:If you so desire, I can extend the time (of my stay) with you, but then I shall have to calculate the time (that I stay with you and shall have to spend the same time with other wives). For the virgin woman, (her husband has to stay with her) for a week, and for the woman previously married it is three days",
