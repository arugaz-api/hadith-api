Abu Talha came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him, whereupon he said: Did you spend the night with her. He said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: O Allah, bless both of them (and as a result of blessing) she gave birth to a child. Abu Talha said to me (Anas b. Malik) to take the child, (so I took him) and came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). She (Umm Sulaim) also had sent some dates (along with the child). Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) took him (the child) (in his lap) and said: Is there anything with you (for Tahnik). They (the Companions) said: Yes. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) took hold of them (dates and chewed them). He then put them (the chewed dates) in the mouth of the child and then rubbed his palate and gave him the name of 'Abdullah","grades":[],"reference":{"book":38,"hadith":28}}}
