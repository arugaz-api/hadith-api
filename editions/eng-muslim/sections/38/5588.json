He set forth with his son carrying him on his back and came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and said: Allah's Messenger a son has been born to me and I have given him the name after the name of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Give him my name but do not give him my kunya, for I am Qasim in the sense that I distribute (the spoils of war) and the dues of Zakat amongst you",
