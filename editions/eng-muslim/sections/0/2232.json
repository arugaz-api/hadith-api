    "text": "Jubair b. Nufair says:I heard it from 'Auf b. Malik that the Prophet (ï·º) said prayer on the dead body, and I remembered his prayer:\" O Allah! forgive him, have mercy upon him, give him peace and absolve him. Receive him with honour and make his grave spacious; wash him with water, snow and hail. Cleanse him from faults as Thou wouldst cleanse a white garment from impurity. Requite him with an abode more excellent than his abode, with a family better than his family, and with a mate better than his mate. Admit him to the Garden, and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of the Fire.\" ('Auf bin Malik) said: I earnestly desired that I were this dead body",
