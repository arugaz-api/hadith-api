    "text": "It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Humaid as-Sa'idi that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appointed a man in charge of Sadaqa (authorising him to receive charity from the people on behalf of the State). He came (back to the Holy prophet) with a large number of things and started saying:This is for you and this has been presented to me as a gift. Here follows the tradition that has gone before except that 'Urwa (one of the narrators in the chain of transmitters) asked Abu Humaid: Did you hear it from the Messenger of Allah (himself) (ﷺ)? He replied: My ears heard it from his mouth",
