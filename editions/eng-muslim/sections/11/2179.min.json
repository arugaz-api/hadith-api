Then 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr got it and said:I would keep it in order to shroud myself in it. He then said: If Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, would have desired it for His Apostle, he would have been shrouded with it. So he sold it and gave its price in charity","grades":[],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":57}}}
