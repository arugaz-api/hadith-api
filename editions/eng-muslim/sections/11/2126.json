    "text": "Umm Salama reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:If any Muslim who suffers some calamity says, what Allah has commanded him,\" We belong to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allah, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it,\" Allah will give him something better than it in exchange. When Abu Salama died she said: What Muslim is better than Abu Salama whose family was the first to emigrate to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I then said the words, and Allah gave me God's Messenger (ﷺ) in exchange. She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent Hatib b. Abu Balta'a to deliver me the message of marriage with him. I said to him: I have a daughter (as my dependant) and I am of jealous temperament. He (the Holy Prophet) said: So far as her daughter is concerned, we would supplicate Allah, that He may free her (of her responsibility) and I would also supplicate Allah to do away with (her) jealous (temperament)",
