    "text": "Safwan b. Ya'la b. Umayya thus reported from his father:I participated in the expedition to Tabuk with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). And Ya'la used to say: That was the most weighty of my deeds, in my opinion. Safwan said that Ya'la had stated: I had a servant; he quarrelled with another person, and the one bit the hand of the other. ('Ata' said that Safwan had told him which one had bitten the hand of the other.) So he whose hand was bitten drew ill from (the mouth) of the one who had bitten it and (in this scuffle) one of his foreteeth was also drawn out. They both came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he declared his (claim for the compensation of) tooth as invalid",
