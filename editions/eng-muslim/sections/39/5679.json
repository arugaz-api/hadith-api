    "text": "Safiyya daughter of Huyyay (the wife of Allah's Apostle) reported that while Allah's Messenger (may peace be. upon him) had been observing I'tikaf, I came to visit him one night and talked with him for some time. Then I stood up to go back and he (Allah's Apostle) also stood up with me in order to bid me good-bye. She was at that time residing in the house of Usama b. Zaid. The two persons from the Ansar happened to pass by him. When they saw Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). they began to walk swiftly, thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them:Walk calmy, she is Safiyya daughter of Huyyay... Both of them said: Messenger, hallowed be Allah, (we cannot conceive of ab., ug doubtful even in the remotest corners of our minds), whereupon he said: Satan circulates in the body of man like the circulation of blood and I was afraid lest it should instill any evil in your heart or anything",
