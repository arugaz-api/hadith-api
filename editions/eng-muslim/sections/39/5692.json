    "text": "Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr reported that the was married to Zubair. He had neither land nor wealth nor slave nor anything else like it except a bom. She further said:I grazed his horse. provided fodder to it and looked after it, and ground dates for his camel. Besides this, I grazed the camel, made arrangements for providing it with water and patched up the leather bucket and kneaded the flour. But I was not proficient in baking the bread, so my female neighbours used to bake bread for me and they were sincere women. She further said: I was carrying on my head the stones of the dates from the land of Zubair which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had endowed him and it was at a distance of two miles (from Medina). She add: As I was one day carrying the atones of dates upon my head I happened to meet Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with a group of his Companions. He called me and said (to the camel) to sit down so that he should make cite ride behind hirn. (I told my husband: ) I felt shy and remembered your jealousy, whereupon he said: By Allah. the carrying of the stone dates upon your bead is more severe a burden than riding with him. She said: (I led the life of hardship) until Abu Bakr sent afterwards a female servant who took upon herself the responsibility of looking after the horse and I felt as it she had emancipated me",
