He bestowed on Aqra' b. Habis one hundred camels, and bestowed an equal (number) upon 'Uyaina, and bestowed on people among the elites of Arabia, and preferred them (to others) on that day, in the distribution (of spoils). Upon this a person said: By Allah, neither justice has been done in this distribution (of spoils), nor has the pleasure of Allah been sought in it. I (the narrator ) said: By Allah, I will certainly inform the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it. I came to him and informed him about what he had said. The colour of his (the Prophet's) face changed red like blood and he then said: \"Who would do justice, if Allah and His Messenger do not do justice?\" He further said: \"May Allah have mercy upon Moses; he was tormented more than this, but he showed patience.\" I said: Never would I convey him (the Holy Prophet) after this (unpleasant) narration","grades":[],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":184}}}
