They again begged him and he again gave them, till when what was in his possession was exhausted he said:Whatever good (riches, goods) I have, I will not withhold it from you. He who refrains from begging Allah safeguards him against want. and he who seeks sufficiency, Allah would keep him in a state of sufficiency, and he who shows endurance. Allah would grant him power to endure, and none is blessed with an endowment better and greater than endurance","grades":[],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":161}}}
