    "text": "Abu Haraira reported that the likeness of one who spends or one who gives charity is that of a person who has two cloaks or two coats-of-mail over him right from the breast to the collar bones. And when the spender (and the other narrator said, when the giver of charity) makes up his mind to give charity, it (coat-mail) becomes expanded for him.

Abu Huraira said:(The miserly man) tries to expand it (the coat-of-mail) but it does not expand",
