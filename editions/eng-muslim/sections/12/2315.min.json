Malik is reported as saying:Abu Talha was the one among the Ansar of Medina who possessed the largest property and among his property he valued most was his garden known as Bairaha' which was opposite the mosque, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) often visited it and he drank of its sweet water. When this verse was revealed: \"You will never attain righteousness till you give freely of what you love\" (iii. 91), Abu Talha got up and, going to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), said: Allah says in His Book: \"You will never attain righteousness till you give freely of what you love,\" and the dearest of my property is Bairaha' so I give it as Sadaqa to God from Whom I hope for reward for it and the treasure with Allah; so spend it, Messenger of Allah, on whatever purpose you deem it proper. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Well done! that is a profitable deal, that is a profitable deal. I have heard what you have said, but I think you should spend it on your nearest relatives. So Abu Talha distributed it among the nearest relatives and his cousins on his father's side","grades":[],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":52}}}
