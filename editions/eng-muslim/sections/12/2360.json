    "text": "Abu Haraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave similitudes of a miserly man and the giver of charity as two persons who have two coats-of-mail over them with their hands pressed closely to their breasts and their collar bones.

And whenever the miserly person intends to give charity (the coat-of-mail) contracts and every ring grips the place where it is. He (Abu Huraira) said:I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying with fingers in the opening of his shirt:\" If you had seen him trying to expand it, it will not expand",
