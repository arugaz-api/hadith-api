    "text": "A'isha reported Allah's Messenger (ï·º) did an act, and held it to be valid. This news reached some persons amongst his Companions (and it was felt) that they did not approve of it and avoided (it). This reaction of theirs was conveyed to him. He stood to deliver an address; and said:What has happened to the people to whom there was conveyed on my behalf a matter for which I granted permission and they disapproved it and avoided it? By Allah, I have the best knowledge of Allah amongst them, and I fear Him most amongst them",
