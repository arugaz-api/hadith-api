He was on the horse of Abu Talha which had no saddle over it, and a sword was slung round his neck, and he was saying:There was nothing to be afraid of, and he also said: We found it (this horse) like a torrent of water (indicating its swift-footedness), whereas the horse had been slow before that time","grades":[],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":65}}}
