He said: I was informed that Gabriel (Allah be pleased with him) came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and there was with him Umin Salama and he began to talk with him. He then stood up, whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to Umm Salama: (Do you know) who was he and what did he say? She said: He was Dihya (Kalbi). He reported Umm Salama having said: By Allah, I did not deem him but only he (Dihya) until I heard the address of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) informing him about us. He (the narrator) said: I said to Uthman: From whom did you hear it? He said: From Usima b. Zaid",
