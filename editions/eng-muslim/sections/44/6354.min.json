'Abdullah reported:The dead body of my father was brought and he was covered (with cloth) and it had been mutilated. I made an attempt to lift the cloth, but my people prohibited me to do so. I again made an attempt to lift the cloth, but my people prohibited me. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ï·º) lifted it or he commanded it to be lifted. He heard the noise (of a loud) weeping, or the noise of a woman mourner. He inquired who she was. They said: The daughter of 'Amr or the sister of Amr, whereupon he said: Why does she weep? The Angels provide him shade with the help of their Wings until he would be lifted (to his heavenly abode)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":44,"hadith":184}}}
