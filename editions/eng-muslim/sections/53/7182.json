    "text": "Abu Sa'id reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:When the inmates of Paradise would be admitted to Paradise and the inmates of Hell would be admitted to Hell, it would be said (to the inmates of Paradise): 0 inmates of Paradise. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation (that he only) said. That is the word of Allah, the Exalted. And he did not say: Then Allah's Mes- senger (ﷺ) recited, and he did not make a mention of his having pointed with his hand towards the (material) world",
