He forbade Mulamasa and Munabadha in transactions. Mulamasa means the touching of another's garment with his hand, whether at night or by day, without turning it over except this much. Munabadha means that a man throws his garment to another and the other throws his garment, and thus confirming their contract without the inspection of mutual agreement",
