Umar (Allah be pleased with them) used to give land on rent until (this news) reached him that Rafi b. Khadij Ansari used to forbid the renting of land. Abdullah met him and said:Ibn Khadij, what is this that you narrate from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) pertaining to renting of land? Rafi b. Khadij said to Abdullah: I heard it from two uncles of mine and they had participated in the Battle of Badr who narrated to the members of the family that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade the renting of land. Abdullah said: I knew it that the land was rented during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Abdullah then apprehended that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have said something new in this connection (in regard to prohibition of renting) which I failed to know. So he abandoned the renting of land","grades":[],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":143}}}
