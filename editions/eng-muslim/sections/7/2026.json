    "text": "Ibn Abu Rafi' said:Marwan appointed Abu Huraira as his deputy in Medina and he himself left for Mecca. Abu Huraira led us in the Jumu'a prayer and recited after Surah Jumu'a in the second rak'ah:\" When the hypocrites came to thee\" (Surah 63). I then met Abu Huraira as he came back and said to him: You have recited two surahs which 'Ali b. Abu Talib used to recite in Kufah. Upon this Abu Huraira said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) reciting these two in the Friday (prayer)",
