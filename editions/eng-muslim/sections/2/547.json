Alfan said: The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) observed: He who completed ablution as Allah, the Exalted, enjoined upon him, his obligatory prayers would be explatious (for his minor sins that he would commit) during (the interval) between them. This hadith is transmitted by Ibn Mu'adh, and in the hadith narrated by Ghundar, the words\" during the governorship of Bishr\" are omitted and there is no mention of the obligatory prayers",
