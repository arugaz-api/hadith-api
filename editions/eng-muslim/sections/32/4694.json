Jabir said: I did not participate in the Battle of Badr and the Battle of Uhud. My father prevented me (from participating in these battles as my age was tender). After `Abdullah (my father) was killed on the Day of Uhud, I never lagged behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and joined every battle (he fought)",
