    "text": "It has been narrated on the authority of Usama b. Zaid that the Prophet (ﷺ) rode a donkey. It had on it a saddle under which was a mattress made at Fadak (a place near Medina). Behind him he seated Usama. He was going to the street of Banu Harith al-Khazraj to inquire after the health of Sa'd b. Ubada This happened before the Battle of Badr. (He proceeded) until he passed by a mixed company of people in which were Muslims, polytheists, idol worshippers and the Jews and among them were 'Abdullah b. Ubayy and 'Abdullah b. Rawaha. When the dust raised by the hoofs of the animal spread over the company, 'Abdullah b. Ubayy covered his nose with his mantle and said:Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Prophet (ﷺ) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and recited to them the Qur'an. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah b. Rawaha said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love (to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Prophet (ﷺ) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa'd b. 'Ubida. He said: Sa'd, haven't you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning 'Abdullah b. Ubayy) has said? He has said so and so. Sa'd said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him",
