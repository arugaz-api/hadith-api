There were some amongst us who had put on IHram for Umra and there were some who had put on Ihram for Hajj. (We proceeded on till) we came to Mecca. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who put on Ihram for 'Umra but did not bring the sacrificial animal with him should put it off. and he who put on Ihram for Umra and he who had brought the sacrificial animal with him should not put it off until he had slaughtered the animal; and he who put on lhram for Hajj should complete it. A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: I was in the monthlyperiod, and I remained In this state till the day of 'Arafa, and I had entered into the state of Ihram for 'Umra. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) thus commanded me to undo my hair and comb them (again) and enter into the state of Ihram for Hajj, and abandon (the rites of 'Umra). She ('A'isha) said: I did so, and when I had completed my Pilgrimage, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent with me 'Abd al-Rabman b. Abu Bakr and commanded me to (resume the rites of) 'Umra at Tan'im. the place where (I abandoned) 'Umra and put on Ihram for Hajj (before completing Umra)",
