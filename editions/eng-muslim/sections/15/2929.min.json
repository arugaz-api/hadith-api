She (A'isha) said: (And consequently) those who did not bring the sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram; and among his wives (too) who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram. A'isha said: I entered my period and could not (therefore) circumambulate the House. When it was the night of Hasba she said: Messenger of Allah, people are coming back (after having performed both) Hajj and'Umra, whereas I am coming back only with Hajj, whereupon he said: Did you not circumambulate (the Ka'ba) that very night we entered Mecca? She (A'isha) said: No, whereupon he said: Go along with your brother to Tan'im and put on the Ihram for Umra, and it is at such and such a place that you can meet (us). (In the meanwhile) Safiyya (the wife of the Holy Prophet) said: I think, I will detain you (since I have entered in the monthly) period and you shall have to wait for me for the farewell circuit). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: May you be wounded and your head shorn did you not circumambulate on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja)? She said: Yes. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: There is no harm. You should go forward. 'A'isha said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was going upwards to the side of Mecca, whereas I was coming down from it, or I was going upward, whereas he was coming down. Isbiq said: She was climbing down, and he was climbing down","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":138}}}
