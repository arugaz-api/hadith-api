'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We entered with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the state of Ihram for Hajj. When we came to Mecca he commanded us to put off Ihram and make it for 'Umra. We felt it (the command) hard for us, and our hearts were anguished on account of this and it (this reaction of the people) reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We do not know whether he received (this news) from the Heaven (through revelation) or from the people. (Whatever the case might be) he said; O people, put off Ihram. If there were not the sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as you do. So we put off the Ihram (after performing Umra), and we had intercourse with our wives and did everything which a non-Muhrim does (applying perfume, putting on clothes, etc.), and when It was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) we turned our back to Mecca (in order to go to Mini, 'Arafat) and we put on lhram for Hajj","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":153}}}
