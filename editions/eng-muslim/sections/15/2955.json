    "text": "Hisham narrated on the authority of his father that the Arabs with the exception of Hums who were Quraish, and their descendants, circumambulated the House naked. They kept circumambulating In this state of nudity unless the Hums supplied to them the clothes. The male provided (clothes) to the male and the female provided clothes to the female. And the Hums did not get out of Muzdalifa, whereas the people (other than the Quraish) went t o 'Arafat. Hisham said on the authority of his father who related from 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) who said:Hums are those about whom Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:\" Then hasten to where the people hasten.\" She (further) said: The people hastened on from 'Arafat, whereas Hums hastened from Muzdalifa, and said: We'do not hasten but from Haram. But when this (verse) was revealed:\" Hasten on from that (place) where the people hasten on,\" they (the Quraish) then went to 'Arafat",
