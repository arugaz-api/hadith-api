    "text": "Ubaid b. Juraij said to 'Ahdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them):'Abd al-Rahman, I find you doing four things which I do not see anyone among your companions doing. He said: Son of Juraij, what are these? Thereupon he said: You (while circumambulating the Ka'ba) do not touch but the two pillars situated on the side of yaman (south), and I find you wearing the sandals of tanned leather, and I find you with dyed beard and head, and I also found that, when you were at Mecca, the people pronounced Talbiya as they saw the new moon (Dhu'l-Hijja), but you did not do it till the 8th of Dhu'l-Hijja. Upon this 'Abdullab b. 'Umar said: (So far as the touching of) the pillars is concerned, I did not see the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) touching them but only those situated on the side of yaman. (So far as the wearing of) the shoes of tanned leather is concerned, I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wearing shoes without hair on them, and he (wore them with wet feet) after performing ablution, and I like to wear them. So far as the yellowness is concerned, I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) dyeing (head, beard and cloth) with this colour and I love to dye (my head, beard or cloth) with this colour. And so far as the pronouncing of Talbiya is concerned, I did not see the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) pronouncing it until his camel proceeded on (to Dhu'l-Hulaifa)",
