She said: We have only two camels for carrying water. One of the camels has been taken by my husband and my son for performing Hajj and one has been left for us for carrying water, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: So when the month of Ramadan come, perform Umra, for'Umra in this (month) is equal to Hajj (in reward)",
