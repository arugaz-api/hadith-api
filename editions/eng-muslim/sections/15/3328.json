Neither an obligatory act nor a supererogatory act would be accepted from him as recompense on the Day of Resurrection; and in the hadith transmitted by two other narrators these words are not found:\" He who claimed false paternity.\" And in the hadith transmitted by Waki' there is no mention of the Day of Resurrection",
