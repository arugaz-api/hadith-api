{"author":"Sahih Muslim","hadith":{"hadithnumber":2922,"arabicnumber":1211.13,"text":"A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported:We proceeded with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) putting on the Ihram for Hajj during the months of Hajj and the night of Hajj till we encamped at Sarif. He (the Holy Prophet) went to his Companions and said: He who has no sacrificial animal with him, in his case I wish that he should perform Umra (with this Ihram), and he who has the sacrificial animal with him should not do it. So some of them performed Hajj whereas others who had no sacrificial animals with them did not do (Hajj, but performed only 'Umra). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had a sacrificial animal with him and those too who could afford it (performed) Hajj). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me (i. e. A'isha) while I was weeping, and he said: What makes you weep? I said: I heard your talk with Companions about Umra. He said: What has happened to you? I said: I do not observe prayer (due to the monthly period), whereupon he said: It would not harm you; you should perform (during this time) the rituals of Hajj (which you can do outside the House). Maybe Allah will compensate you for this. You are one among the daughters of Adam and Allah has ordained for you as He has ordained for them. So I proceeded on (with the rituals of Hajj) till we came to Mina. I washed myself and then circumambulated the House, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) encamped at Muhassab and called, Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr. and said: Take out your sister from the precincts of the Ka'ba in order to put on Ihram for Umra and circumambulate the House. and I shall wait for you here. She said: So I went out and put on Ihram and then circumambulated the House, and (ran) between al-Safa and al-Marwa, and then we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was in his house in the middle of the night. He said: Have you completed your (rituals)? I said: Yes. He then announced to his Companions to march on. He came out, and went to the House and circumambulated it before the dawn prayer and then proceeded to Medina","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":131}}}
