I put on Ihram for Umra and did not bring the sacrificial animal. The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who has the sacrihcial animal with him should enter into the state of Ihram for Hajj along with 'Umra, and. he should not put the Ihram off till he has completed both of them. She (Hadrat A'isha) said: The monthly period began. When it was the night of Arafa, I said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): I entered into the state of Ihram for 'Umra. but now how should I perform the Hajj? Thereupon he said: Undo your hair and comb them, and desist from performing Umra, and put on Ihram for Hajj She (A'isha, said: When I had completed my Hajj he commanded 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr to carry me behind him (on boneback) in order to enable me to resume the rituals of Umra from Tan'im, the place where I abandoned its rituals",
