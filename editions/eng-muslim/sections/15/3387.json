How did you hear your father making mention of the mosque founded on Piety? He said: My father said: I went to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) as he was in the house of one of his wives, and said: Messenger of Allah, which of the two mosques is founded on piety? Thereupon he took a handful of pebbles and threw them on the ground and then said: This is the very mosque of yours (mosque at Medina). He (the narrator) said: I bear witness that I heard your father making mention of it",
