    "text": "Asma bint Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported:We set out (to Mecca) in a state of Ihram. Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said: He who has the sacrificial animal with him should remain in the state of Ihram, but he who has not the sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. As I had not the sacrificial animal with me, I put off Ihram. And since Zubair (her husband) - had the sacrificial animal with him, he did not put off Ihram. She (Asma) said: I put on my clothes and then went out and sat by Zabair, whereupon he said: Go away from me, whereupon I said: Do you fear that I would jump upon you?",
