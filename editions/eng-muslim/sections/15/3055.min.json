{"author":"Sahih Muslim","hadith":{"hadithnumber":3055,"arabicnumber":"1264.01","text":"Abu Tufail reported:I said to Ibn `Abbas (Allah be pleased with them): Do you think that walking swiftly round the House in three circuits, and just walking in four circuits is the Sunnah (of the Holy Prophet), for your people say that it is Sunnah? Thereupon he (Ibn `Abbas) said: They have told the truth and the lie (too). I said: What do your words \"They have told the truth and the lie (too)\" imply? Thereupon he said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Mecca and the polytheists said that Muhammad and his Companions had emaciated and would, therefore, be unable to circumambulate the House; and they felt jealous of him (the Holy Prophet). (It was due to this) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded them to walk swiftly in three (circuits) and walk (normally) in four. I said to him: Inform me if it is Sunnah to observe Tawaf between al-Safa and al-Marwa while riding, for your people look upon it as Sunnah. He (Ibn `Abbas) said: They have told the truth and the lie too. I said: What do your words \"They have told the truth and the lie too\" imply? He said: When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to Mecca, there was such a large gathering of people around him that even the virgins had come out of their houses (to catch a glimpse of his face). And they were saying: He is Muhammad; He is Muhammad. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (was so gentle and kind) that the people were not beaten back (to make way) in front of him. When there was a throng (of people) around him, he rode (the she-camel). However, walking and trotting are better","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":261}}}
