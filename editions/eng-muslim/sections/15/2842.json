    "text": "Muhammad b. al-Muntashir reported on the authority of his father:I asked 'Abdullah b. 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) about a person who applied perfume and then (on the following) morning entered upon the state of lhram. Thereupon he said: I do not like to enter upon the state of Ihram shaking off the perfume. Rubbing of tar (upon my body) is dearer to me than doing this (i. e. the applying of perfume), I went to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and told her that Ibn 'Umar stated:\" I do not like to enter upon the state of Ihram shaking off the perfume. Rubbing of tar (upon my body) is dearer to me than doing it (the applying of perfume).\" Thereupon 'A'isha said: I applied perfume to the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) at the time of his entering upon the state of Ihram. He then went round his wives and then put on Ihram in the morning",
