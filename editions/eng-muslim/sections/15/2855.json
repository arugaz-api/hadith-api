    "text": "Abdullah b. Abu Qatada reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with him):The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out for Pilgrimage and we also set out along with him. He (Abu Qatada) said: There proceeded on some of his Companions and Abu Qatada was (one of them). He (the Prophet) said: You proceed along the coastline till you meet me. He (Abu Qatada) said: So they proceeded ahead of the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ), all of them had entered upon the state of Ihram, except Abu Qatada; he had not put on ihram. As they went on they saw a wild ass, and Abu Qatada attacked it and cut off its hind legs. They got down and ate its meat. They said: We ate meat In the state of Ihram. They carried the meat that was left of it. As they came to the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) they said: Messenger of Allah, we were in the state of Ihram whereas Abu Qatada was not. We saw a wild ass and Abu Qatada attacked it and cut off its hind legs. We got down and ate its meat and we thus ate the meat of a game while we were In the state of Ihram. We have (carried to you) what was left out of its meat. Thereupon he (the holy Prophet) said: Did anyone among you command him (to hunt) or point to him with anything (to do so)? They said: No. Thereupon he said: Then eat what is left out of its meat",
