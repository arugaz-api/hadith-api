    "text": "A'isha said:I wish I had sought permission from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as Sauda had sought, and observed the dawn prayer at Mina and stoned at al-Jamra before the people had come there. It was said to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her): Did Sauda seek permission from him (the Holy Prophet)? She said: Yes. She was a bulky lady and so she sought permission from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (to proceed to mina from Muzdalifa ahead of him), and he granted her permission",
