Marwan during his caliphate. 'Abd al-Malik said:I do riot think that Abu Khubaib (i. e. Ibn Zabair) had heard from 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) (about the intended wish of the Prophet [may peace be upon him) In regard to the alteration of the Ka'ba). Harith said: Yes, I myself did hear from her. He ('Abd al-Malik) said: Well, tell me what you heard from her. He stated that she (Hadrat 'A'isha) had said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) remarked: Verily your people have reduced (the area) of the House from its (original foundations, and if they had not recently abandoned polytheism (and embraced Islam) I would have reversed it to (those foundations) which they had left out of it. nd if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I should show you what they have left out of it. He showed her about fifteen cubits of area from the side of Hatim (that they had separated). This is the narration transmitted by 'Abdullah b. Ubaid. Walid b. 'Ata' has, however, made this addition to it:\" Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: I would have made two doors on the level of the ground (facing) the east and the west. Do you know why your people raised the level of its door (i. e. the door of the Ka'ba)? She said: No. He said: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to him only whom they wished. When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb (the stairs), and as he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down.\" 'Abd al-Malik said to Harith; Did you yourself hear her saying this? He said: Yes. He (Harith) said that he ('Abd al-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff for some time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair's) work there","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":450}}}
