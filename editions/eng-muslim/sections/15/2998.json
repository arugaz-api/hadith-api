    "text": "Wabara reported:A person asked Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him): May I circumambulate the House, whereas I have entered-into the state of Ihram for Hajj? Thereupon he said: What prevents you from doing it? He said: I saw the son of so and so showing disapproval of it, and you are dearer to us as compared with him. And we see that he is allured by the world, whereupon he said: Who amongst you and us is not allured by the world? And said (further) ': 'We saw that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) put on Ihram for Hajj and circumambulated the House and run between al Safa' and al-Marwa. And the way prescribed by Allah and that prescribed by His Apostle (ﷺ) deserve more to be followed than the way shown by so and so, if you speak the truth",
