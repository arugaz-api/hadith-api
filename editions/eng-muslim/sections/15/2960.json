Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon, him) said to me: Abu Musa, what did you ' say when you entered into the state of Ihram? I said: At thy beck and call; my (Ihram) is that of the Ihram of Allah's Apostle (May peace be upon him). He said: Have you brought the sacrificial animals? I said: No. Thereupon he said: Go and circumambulate the House, and (run) between al-Safa' and al-Marwa and then put off Ihram. The rest of the hadith is the same",
