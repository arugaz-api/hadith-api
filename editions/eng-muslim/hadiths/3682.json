It was after this that this verse was revealed:\" Thou mayest put off whom thou pleasest of them, and take for thee whom thou pleasest\" (xxxiii. 5). Mu'adha said to her: What did you say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when he sought your permission? She said: I used to say: If it had the option in this I would not have (allowed anyone) to have precedence over me",
