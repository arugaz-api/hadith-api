    "text": "Muhammad b. al-Muntashir reported on the authority of his father:I heard from Ibn 'Umar having said this:\" It is dearer to me to rub tar (on my body) than to enter upon the state of Ihram (in a state) of shaking off the perfume.\" He (the narrator) said: I went to 'A'isha and told her about this statement of his (of Ibn 'Umar). Thereupon she said: I applied perfume to the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) and he then went round his wives and then entered upon the state of Ihram in the morning",
