So he gave him that and then came and said: I gave him honey but it has only made his bowels more loose. He said this three times; and then he came the fourth time, and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Give him honey. He said: I did give him, but it has only made his bowels more loose, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Allah has spoken the truth and your brother's bowels are in the wrong. So he made him drink (honey) and he was recovered",
