    "text": "Abdullah b. Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) led us 'Isha' prayer at the latter part of the night and when he had concluded it by salutations he stood up and said:Have you seen this night of yours? At the end of one hundred years after this none would survive on the surface of the earth (from amount my Companions). Ibn Umar said: People were (not understanding) these words of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) which had been uttered pertaining to one hundred years. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in fact meant (by these words) that on that day none from amongst those who had been living upon the earth (from amongst his Companions) would survive (after one hundred years) and that would be the end of this generation",
