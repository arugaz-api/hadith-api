    "text": "Sufyan reported:I said to Zuhri: Abu Bakr, what does this hadith mean:\" The worst kind of food is at a wedding feast of the rich\"? He laughed and said: The food served in the feast given by the rich is not worst (in itself). Sufyan said: My father was rich, so I felt disturbed when I heard this hadith, so I asked Zuhri who said: I heard from 'Abd al-Rahman al-Alraj that he heard Abu Huraira (Allah he pleased with him) say: The worst kind of food is that served at the wedding feast. The rest of the hadith is the same",
