{"author":"Sahih Muslim","hadith":{"hadithnumber":7037,"arabicnumber":"2779.03","text":"Abu Tufail reported that there was a dispute between Hudhaifa and one from the people of Aqaba as it happens amongst people. He said:I adjure you by Allah to tell me as to how many people from Aqaba were. The people said to him (Hudhaifa) to inform him as he had asked. We have been informed that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (ﷺ) in this world. The rest of the three put forward this excuse: We did not hear the announcement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we were not aware of the intention of the people as he (the Holy Prophet) had been in the hot atmosphere. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The water is small in quantity (at the next station). So nobody should go ahead of me, but he found people who had gone ahead of him and he cursed them on that day","grades":[],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":14}}}
