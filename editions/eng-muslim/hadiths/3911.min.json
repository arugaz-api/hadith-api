Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbidding Muhaqala, and Muzabana, and Mukhabara, and the buying of date-palm until its fruit is ripened (ripening means that its colour becomes red or yellow, or it is fit for being eaten).

Zaid (one of the narrators) said to Ata' b. Abu Rabah (the other narrator):Did You bear Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) making a mention of it that he had heard it directly from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? He said: Yes","grades":[],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":110}}}
