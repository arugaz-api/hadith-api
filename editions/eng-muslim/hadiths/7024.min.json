'Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and informed him about that and he sent someone to 'Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth:\" When the hypocrites come\" (lxiii. 1). Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) then called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons","grades":[],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":1}}}
