{"author":"Sahih Muslim","hadith":{"hadithnumber":6773,"arabicnumber":2663.04,"text":"Ibn Mas'dd reported that Umm Habiba said:0 Allah, enable me to derive benefit from my husband, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and from my father Abu Sufyan, and from my brother Mu'awiya. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to her: Verily, you have asked Allah about the durations of life already set, and the steps which you would take, and the sustenances the share of which is fixed. Nothing would take place earlier than its due time, and nothing would be deferred beyond that when it is due. So, if you were to ask Allah about your safety from the torment of Hell-Fire and from the torment of the grave, it would have been better for you. A person said: Allah's Messenger, what about those apes and swine which suffered metamorphosis? Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, did not destroy a people or did not torment a people, and let their race grow. Apes and swine had been even before that (when the deniers of truth were tormented and suffered metamorphosis). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sufyin through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording","grades":[],"reference":{"book":46,"hadith":51}}}
