Abi Talib (Allah be pleased with him) to the Yemen and sent to his wife the one pronouncement of divorce which was still left from the (irrevocable) divorce; and he commanded al-Harith b. Hisham and 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabi'a to give her maintenance allowance. They said to her:By Allah, there is no maintenance allowance for you, except in case you are pregnant. She came to Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) and mentioned their opinion to him, whereupon he said: There is no maintenance allowance for you. Then she sought permission to move (to another place), and he (the Holy Prophet) permitted her. She said: Allah's Messenger, where (should I go)? He said: To the house of Ibn Umm Maktum and, as he is blind, she could put off her garmeqts in his presence and he would not see her. And when her 'Idda was over. Allah's Apostle (ï·º) married her to Usama b. Zaid. Marwan (the governor of Medina) sent Qabisa b. Dhuwaib in order to ask her about this hadith, and she narrated it to him, whereupon Marwan said: We have not heard this hadith but from a woman. We would adopt a safe (path) where we found the people. Fatima said that when these words of, Marwan were conveyed to her. There is between me and you the word of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic: Do\" not turn them out\" of their houses. She asserted: This is in regard to the revocable divorce what new (turn can the event take) after three pronouncements (separation between irrevocable). Why do you say there is no maintenance allowance for her if she is not pregnant? Then on what ground do you restrain her?",
