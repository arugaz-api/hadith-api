He said: I went away and, lo, it was 'Umar. I opened it for him and gave him the glad tidings of Paradise.

I went and, lo, it was 'Uthman b. 'Affan. 1 opened the door and gave him the glad tidings of Paradise and informed him (what the Prophet had said). Thereupon he said: O Allah, grant me steadfastness.
