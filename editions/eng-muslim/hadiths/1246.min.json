'A'isha said to him: What is the matter with you that you do not narrate as this son of my brother narrated (the ahaditb)? Well I know from where you picked it up. This is how his mother brought him up and how your mother brought you up. Qasim felt angry (on this remark of Hadrat 'A'isha) and showed bitterness towards her. When he saw that the table had been spread for 'A'isha, he stood up, 'A'isha, said: Where are you going? He said: (I am going) to say prayer. She said: Sit down (to take the food). He said: I must say prayer. She said: Sit down, ) faithless, for I have heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) say: No prayer can be (rightly said) when the food is there (before the worshipper), or when he is prompted by the call of nature","grades":[],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":84}}}
