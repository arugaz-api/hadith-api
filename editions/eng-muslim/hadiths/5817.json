    "text": "Urwa reported from 'A'isha that she said that people asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the kahins. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them:It is nothing (i. e. it is a mere superstition). They said: Allah's Messenger, they at times narrate to us things which we find true. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: That is a word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches away and then cackles into the ear of his friend as the hen does. And then they mix in it more than one hundred lies",
