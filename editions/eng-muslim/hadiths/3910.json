    "text": "Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) forbade Mukhabara and Muhaqala, and Muzabana, and the sale of the fruit until it is fit for eating, and its sale but with dirham and dinar. Exception is made in case of 'araya. Ata' said:Jabir explained (these terms) for us. As for Mukhabara it is this that a wasteland is given by a person to another and he makes an investment in it and then gets a share in the produce. According to him (Jabir), Muzabana is the sell of fresh dates on the tree for dry dates with a measure, and Muhaqala in agriculture implies that one should sell the standing crop for grains with a measure",
