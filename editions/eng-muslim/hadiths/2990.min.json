I was with him (the Holy Prophet) when the infidels of Quraish caused obstructions between him (the Holy Prophet) and the House. I call you as my witness (to the fact) that I have made 'Umra essential for me. He proceeded until he came to Dhu'l-Hulaifa and pronounced Talbiya for Umra, and said: If the way Is clear forme, I would then complete my 'Umra but If there is some obstruction between me and that (the Ka'ba). I would then do what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had done (at the occasion of Hudaibiya), and I was with him (the Holy Prophet). and then recited:\" Verily in the Messenger of Allah, there is a model pattern for you\" (xxxiii. 21).
