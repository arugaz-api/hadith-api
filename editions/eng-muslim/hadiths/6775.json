    "text": "A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited (these verses of the Qur'an):\"He it is Who revealed to thee (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur'an) wherein there are clear revelations-these are the substance of the Book and others are allegorical (verses). And as for those who have a yearning for error they go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain them. And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of understanding who really heed\" (Al-Qur'an 3:7). 'A'isha (further) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (in connection with these verses): When you see such verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the mentioned verses)",
