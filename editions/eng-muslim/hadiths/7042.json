When I placed my hand upon him, I said: By Allah, I have never seen, till this day, a person running higher temperature than he. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), turning his face to his companions, said: May I not inform you of a severer temperature than this which these two persons would run on the Day of Resurrection?
