    "text": "Khaula bint Hakim Sulamiyya reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: When any one of you stays at a place, he should say:\" I seek refuge in the Perfect Word of Allah from the evil of that He created.\" Nothing would then do him any harm until he moves from that place. Abu Huraira reported that a person came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:\" Allah's Messenger, I was stung by a scorpion during the night. Thereupon he said: Had you recited these words in the evening:\" I seek refuge in the Perfect Word of Allah from the evil of what He created,\" it would not have done any harm to you",
