    "text": "Abu Musa reported that he (and his other companions) were climbing upon the hillock along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and when any person climbed up, he pronounced (loudly):\" There is no god but Allah, Allah is the Greatest.\" Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Verily, you are not supplicating One Who is deaf or absent. He said: Abu Musa or Abdullah b Qais, should I not direct you to the words (which form) the treasure of Paradise? I said: Allah's Messenger, what are these? He said:\" There is no might and no power but that of Allah",
