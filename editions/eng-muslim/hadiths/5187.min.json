I said: He stated that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has forbidden the (preparation of) Nabidh in a green pitcher (besmeared with pitch), whereupon he said: Ibn 'Umar has told the truth. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) declared unlawful the preparation of Nabidh in a green pitcher (besmeared with pitch). I said: What is this thing, the Nabidh of a pitcher (Nabidh prepared in a pitcher)?
