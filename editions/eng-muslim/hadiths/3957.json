Khadij in order to listen from him the hadith transmitted on the authority of his father (pertaining to the renting of land) from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). He (Tawus) scolded him and said: By Allah, it I were to know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had forbidden it, I would have never done it. But it has been narrated to me by one who has better knowledge of it amongst them (and he meant Ibn 'Abbas) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: It is better if a person lends, his land to his brother (for cultivation) than that he gets recognised rent on it",
