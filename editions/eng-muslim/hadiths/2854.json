    "text": "Abdullah b. Abu Qatada reported:My father went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the year of Hudaibiya. His Companions entered upon the state of Ihram whereas he did not, for it was conveyed to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that the enemy (was hiding at) Ghaiqa. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went forward. He (Abu Qatada) said: Meanwhile I was along with his Companions, some of them smiled (to one another) As I cast a glance I saw a wild ass. I attacked It with a spear and held it, and begged for their (i. e. of his companions) assistance, but they refused to help me and we ate its meat. But we were afraid lest we should be separated (from the Messenger of Allah). So I proceeded on (with a view to) seeking the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Some- times I'dashed my horse and sometimes I made it run at a leisurely pace (keeping pace with others). (In the meanwhile) I met a person from Banfu Ghifar in the middle of the night. I said to him: Where did you meet the messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: I left him at Ta'bin and he intended to halt at Suqya to spend the afternoon. I met him and said: Messenger of Allah. your Companions convey salutations and benedictions of Allah to you and they fear that they may not be separated from you (and the enemy may do harm to you), so wait for them, and he (the Holy Prophet) waited for them. I said: Messenger of Allah, I killed a game and there is left with me (some of the meat). The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said to his people: Eat it. And they were in the state of Ihram",
