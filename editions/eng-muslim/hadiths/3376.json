    "text": "Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported:Prayer in the mosque of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is more excellent than a thousand prayers in other mosques except the Masjid al-Haram, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is the last of the Apostles, and his mosque is the last of the mosques. Abu Salama and Abu Abdullah (two of the narrators in this chain of narrations said: We had no doubt that what Abu Haraira (Allah be pleased with him) had said was from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and so we did not like to get an attestation from Abu Huraira about this hadith until Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) died. We discussed it (the issue of getting attestation from Abu Huraira) amongst ourselves and blamed one another as to why we did not talk about it to Abu Huraira regarding it so that he could attribute its transmission to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in case he had heard It from him. While we were discussing it as we sat with 'Abdullah b. Ibrahlm b. Qariz; we made a mention of this hadith, and our omission (in getting its attestation) about its direct transmission by Abu Huraira from him (the Holy Proohet) ; thereupon Abdullah b. Ibrahim said to us: I bear witness to the fact that I heard Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) say that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I am the last of the Apostles and my mosque is the last of the mosques",
