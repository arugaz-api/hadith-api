    "text": "A'isha (Allah's be pleased with her) reported that she had bought Barira from the people of Ansar, but they laid down the condition that the right of inheritance (would vest in them), whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:The right of inheritance vests with one who shows favour (who emancipates) and Allah's Messenger (may peacebe upon him) gave her the choice (either to retain) her matrimonial alliance or break it). Her husband was a slave. She (Barira also) gave 'A'isha some meat as gift. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I wish you could prepare (cook) for us out of this meat. 'A'isha said, It has been given as charity to Barira, whereupon he said: That is charity for her and gift for us",
