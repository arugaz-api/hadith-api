When the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) finished the prayer he said: Who amongst you uttered these words? The people remained silent. He (the Prophet again said) -: Who amongst you uttered these words? He said nothing wrong. Then a man said: I came and had a difficulty in breathing, so I uttered them. He replied: I saw twelve angels facing one another as to who will take them up (to Allah)",
