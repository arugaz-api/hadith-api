A person amongst us said prayer (after having separated himself from the congregation). Mu'adh was informed of this, and he remarked that he was a hypocrite. When it (the remark) was conveyed to the man, he went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him of what Mu'adh had said. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: Mu'adh, do you want to become a person putting (people) to trial? When you lead people in prayer, recite:\" By the Sun and its morning brightness\" (Surat ash-Shams),\" Glorify the name of thy most high Lord\" (Surat al-A`la) and\" Read in the name of Lord\" (Surat al-`Alaq), and\" By the night when it spreads\" (Surat al-Lail)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":203}}}
