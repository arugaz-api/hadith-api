    "text": "A'isha (Allah he pleased with her) reported:There came the wife of Rifa'a to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said: I was married to Rifa'a but he divorced me, making may divorce irrevocable. Afterwards I married Abd al-Rahman b. al-Zubair, but all he possesses is like the fringe of a garment (i. e. he is sexually weak). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled, and said: Do you wish to return to Rifa'a. (You) cannot (do it) until you have tasted his sweetness and he ('Abd al-Rahman) has tasted your sweetness. Abu Bakr was at that time near him (the Holy Prophet) and Khalid (b. Sa'id) was at the door waiting for the permission to be granted to him to enter), He (Khalid) said; Abu Bakr, do you hear what she is saying loudly in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?",
