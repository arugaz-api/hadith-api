Husain reported:I am narrating to you a hadith by which Allah will benefit you (and the hadith is) that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) combined Hajj and 'Umra, and he did not forbid (this combination) till he died. (Moreover) nothing was revealed in the Holy Qur'an which forbade it. And I was always blessed till I was branded and then it (blessing) was abandoned. I then abandoned branding and it (the blessing was restored)",
