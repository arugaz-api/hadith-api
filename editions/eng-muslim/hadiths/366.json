Ma'qil said to him:I am narrating to you a hadith which I would have never narrated to you had I not been in death-bed. I heard Allah's apostle (ï·º) say: A ruler who has been entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims but he makes no endeavors ( for the material and moral uplift) and does not sincerely mean (their welfare) would not enter Paradise along with them",
