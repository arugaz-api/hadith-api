    "text": "Mu'awiya said:Be cautious about ahadith except those which were current during the reign of Umar, for he exhorted people to fear Allah, the Exalted and mMajestic. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: He upon whom Allah intends to bestow goodness, He confers upon him an insight in religion; and I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying: I am the treasurer. To one whom I give out of (my own) sweet will, he would be blessed in that, but he whom I give (yielding to) his constant begging and for his covetousness is like one who would eat, but would not be satisfied",
