Abi Rabah reported that he heard 'A'isha, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him), as saying:When there was on any day windstorm or dark cloud (its effects) could be read on the face of the Messenger of Allah (ï·º), and he moved forward and backward (in a state of anxiety) ; and when it rained, he was delighted and it (the state of restlessness) disappeared.
