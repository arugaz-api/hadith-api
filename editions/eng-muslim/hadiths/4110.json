This vexed the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: He who has a right is entitled to speak, and said to them (his Companions): Buy a camel for him and give that to him. They said: We do not find a camel (of that age) but one with better age than that. He said: Buy that and give that to him, for best of you or best amongst you are those who are best in paying off debt",
