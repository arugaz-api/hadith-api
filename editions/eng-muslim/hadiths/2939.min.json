'Abdullah reported that A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) entered into the state of Ihram (separately) for 'Umra while the Prophet (ﷺ) was performing Hajj.

So he (in pursuance of her desire for a separate lhram for Umra) sent her with 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr and she put on Ihram for 'Umra at al-Tan'im. Matar and Abu Zubair (the two narrators amongst the chain of transmitters) said: Whenever 'A'isha performed Hajj she did as she had done along with Allah's Apostle (ﷺ)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":148}}}
