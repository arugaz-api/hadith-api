'Abdullah al-Bajali said:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me: Can't on rid me of Dhu'I-Khalasah, the idol-house of Khath'am, and this idol-house was called the Yamanite Ka'ba. So I went along with 150 horsemen and I could not sit with steadfastness upon the horse. I made the mention of it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he struck his hand on my chest and said: O Allah, grant him steadfastness and make him the guide of righteousness and the rightly-guided one. So he went away and he set fire to it. Then Jarir sent some person to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whose Kunya was Abu Arta to give him the happy news about that. He came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said: I have not come to you (but with the news) that we have left Dhu'l-Khalasah as a scabed camel. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) blessed the horses of Ahmas and the men of their tribe five times","grades":[],"reference":{"book":44,"hadith":196}}}
