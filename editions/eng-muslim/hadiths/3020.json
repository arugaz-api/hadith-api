    "text": "Ata' said:Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) used to say that a pilgrim or non-pilgrim (one performing 'Umar) who circumambulates the House is free from the responsibility of Ihram. I (Ibn Juraij, one of the narrators) said to 'Ata': On what authority does he (Ibn Abbas) say this? He said: On the authority uf Allah's words:\" Then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House\" (al-Qur'an, xxii. 33). I said: It concerns the time after staying at 'Arafat, whereupon he said: Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had stated (that the place of sacrifice is the Ancient House) ; it way be after staying at 'Arafat or before (staying there). And he (Ibn Abbas) made this deduction I from the command of Allah's Apostle (ï·º) when he had ordered to put off Ihram on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage",
