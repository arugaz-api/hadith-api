    "text": "Abdullah b 'Umar reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) as saying: Three persons belonging to the earlier Ummahs set out on a journey until they had to spend a night in a cave. The rest of the hadith is the same and the additional words are:\" A person amongst them said: O Allah, I had my aged parents and I served them milk before I (served that) to my wife, children and my servants.\" And in case of the second one, the words are: \"She avoided me until she was hard pressed because of famine and she came to me and I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars.\" And in case of the third one (the words are):\" I invested his wages, and it brought profit and, as a result thereof, the merchandise increased and there was an abundance of goods.\" And he (the narrator said) that they got out of the cave and began to walk",
