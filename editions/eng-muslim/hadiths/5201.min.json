Musayyib reported:I heard 'Abdullah b 'Umar saying this near the pulpit while pointing towards the pulpit of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ): A group of the tribe of 'Abd al-Qais came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him about (vessels) which might (be used for preparing Nabidh and) drinking in them. He (the Holy Prophet) forbade them (to use) gourd, hollow stump, vessel besmeared with pitch. I said to him: Abu Muhammad, (what about) varnished jar? and we think he had forgotten to mention the word 'varnished jar\". Thereupon he said: I did not hear it from him on that day, i. e. from 'Abdullah b. 'Umar, and he hated that (i. e. preparation of Nabidh in gourd)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":75}}}
