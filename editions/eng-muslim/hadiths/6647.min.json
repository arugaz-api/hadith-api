Surad reported that two persons abused each other in the presence of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and one of them fell into a rage and his face became red.

Thereupon, a person went to him who had heard that from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said to him: Do you know what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said? He (the Holy Prophet) said: I know of a wording; if he were to say that, (the fit) would be no more (and the words are): I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed. And the person said to him: Do you find me mad?","grades":[],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":144}}}
