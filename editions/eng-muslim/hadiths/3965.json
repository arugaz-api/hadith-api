Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that when Khaibar had been conquered, the Jews asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to let them continue (cultivation in those lands) on half of the share of yield in fruits and crop, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:I will allow you to continue here, so long as we would desire.
