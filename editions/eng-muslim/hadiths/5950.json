    "text": "Jabir b. Abdullah reported:We went along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on an expedition towards Najd and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) found us in a valley abounding in thorny trees. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed for rest under a tree and he suspended his sword by one of its branches under which he was taking rest. The persons scattered in the valley and they also began to take rest under the shade of trees, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: A person came to me while I was asleep and he took hold of the sword. I woke up and found him standing upon my head and I had hardly become alert (and saw) that the sword was in his hand. And he said: Who can protect you from me? I said: Allah. He again said: Who can protect you from me? I said: Allah. He put his sword in the sheath (and you can see) this man sitting here. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not in any way touch him",
