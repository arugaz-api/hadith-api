    "text": "Abu Huraira reported that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned from the expedition to Khaibar, he travelled one night, and stopped for rest when he became sleepy. He told Bilal to remain on guard during the night and he (Bilal) prayed as much as he could, while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions slept. When the time for dawn approached Bilal leaned against his camel facing the direction from which the dawn would appear but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning against his camel, and neither the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) nor Bilal, nor anyone else among his Companions got up, till the sun shone on them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was the first of them to awake and, being startled, he called to Bilal who said:Messenger of Allah I may my father and mother be offered as ransom for thee, the same thing overpowered me which overpowered you. He (the Holy Prophet, then) said: Lead the beasts on: so they led their camels to some distance. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then performed ablution and gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the Iqama and then led them in the morning prayer. When he finished the prayer he said: When anyone forgets the prayer, he should observe it when he remembers it, for Allah has said:\" And observe the prayer for remembrance of Me\" (Qur'an. xx. 14). Yunus said: Ibn Shilab used to recite it like this:\" (And observe the prayer) for remembrance",
