Ima' reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), bowed (in prayer) and then lifted his head and then said:So far as the tribe of Ghifar is concerned, Allah had pardoned it, and Allah had granted protection to the tribe of Aslam, and as for the tribe of Usayya, It had disobeyed Allah and His Messenger, (and further said): O Allah! curse the tribe of Lihyan curse Ri'l, and Dhakwan, and then fell in prostration.
