Safwan reported the Mother of the Faithful as saying that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said:They would soon seek protection in this House, viz.

An army would be sent to fight (and kill) them and when they would enter a plain ground the army would be sunk in it. Yusuf (one of the narrators) said: It was a people of Syria (hordes of Hajjaj) who had been on that day coming towards Mecca for an attack (on 'Abdulllah b. Zubair) and Abdullah b. Safwan said: By God, it does not imply this army","grades":[],"reference":{"book":54,"hadith":9}}}
