    "text": "A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), said:The wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) sent Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ). She sought permission to get in as he had been lying with me in my mantle. He gave her permission and she said: Allah's Messenger, verily, your wives have sent me to you in order to ask you to observe equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She (`A'isha) said: I kept quiet. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to her (Fatima): O daughter, don't you love whom I love? She said: Yes, (I do). Thereupon he said: I love this one. Fatima then stood up as she heard this from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and went to the wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and informed them of what she had said to him and what Allah's messenger (ﷺ) had said to her. Thereupon they said to her: We think that you have been of no avail to us. You may again go to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and tell him that his wives seek equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. Fatima said: By Allah, I will never talk to him about this matter. `A'isha (further) reported: The wives of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) then sent Zainab b. Jahsh, the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), and she was one who was somewhat equal in rank with me in the eyes of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I have never seen a woman more advanced in religious piety than Zainab, more God-conscious, more truthful, more alive to the ties of blood, more generous and having more sense of self-sacrifice in practical life and having more charitable disposition and thus more close to God, the Exalted, than her. She, however, lost temper very soon but was soon calm. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) permitted her to enter as she (`A'isha) was along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in her mantle, in the same very state when Fatima had entered. She said: Allah's Messenger, your wives have sent me to you seeking equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She then came to me and showed harshness to me and I was seeing the eyes of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whether he would permit me. Zainab went on until I came to know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said: She is the daughter of Abu Bakr",
