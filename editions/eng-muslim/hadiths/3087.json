As Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached the left side of the mountain which was situated near Muzdalifa, he made the camel kneel down and made water and then came back. I poured water and he, performed light ablution. I then said: Messenger of Allah, it is time for prayer. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The prayer awaits you (at the next station, Muzdalifa). Allah's Messenger (may peaced be upon him) rode on until he came to Muzdalifa and observed prayer. Then al-Fadl (Allah be pleased with him) sat behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and reached (Muzdalifa) in the morning. Kuraib said: 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) narrated from al-Fadl (Allah be pleased with him) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued pronouncing Talbiya until he reached al-Jamara (al-'Aqaba)",
