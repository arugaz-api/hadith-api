And he [the Prophet] likened him to one who offers a camel as a sacrifice and then he went on in the descending order till he reached the point at which the minimum (sacrifice) is that of an egg. And when the Imam sits (on the pulpit) the sheets are folded and they (the angels) attend to the mention of Allah",
