    "text": "Abu Huraira reported:The poor amongst the emigrants came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: The possessors of great wealth have obtained the highest ranks and the lasting bliss. He (the Holy Prophet) said: How is that? They said: They pray as we pray, and they observe fast as we observe fast, and they give charity but we do not give charity, and they set slaves free but we do not set slaves free. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Shall I not teach you something by which you will catch upon those who have preceded you, and get ahead of those who come after you, only those who do as you do being more excellent than you? They said: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Extol Allah, declare His Greatness, and Praise Him thirty-three times after every prayer. Abu Salih said: The poor amongst the emigrants returned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace upon him) saying: Our brethren, the possessors, of property have heard what we have done and they did the same. So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: This is Allah's Grace which He gives to whom He wishes. Sumayy reported: I made a mention of this hadith to some members of my family (and one of them) said: You have forgotten; he (the Holy Prophet) had said (like this): \"Extol Allah thirty-three time, praise Allah thirty-three times and declare His Greatness thirty-three times.\" Ibn `Ajlan said: I made a mention of this hadith to Raja' b. Haiwa and he narrated to me a hadith like this from Abu Salih from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the authority of Abu Huraira",
