O Umm Rubayyi', Qisas (retribution is a command, prescribed) in the Book of Allah. She said: No, by Allah, Qisas will never be taken from her; and she went on saying this until they (the relatives of the one who had been injured) accepted the blood-wit. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Verily there are amongst the servants of Allah (such pious persons) who, if they take oath of Allah, He honours it","grades":[],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":33}}}
