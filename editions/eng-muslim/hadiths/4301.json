He (my father) then said: We belonged to the family of Muqarrin during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him. and had only one slave-girl and one of us slapped her. This news reached Allah's Apostle (ï·º) and he said: Set her free. They (the members of the family) said: There is no other servant except she.
