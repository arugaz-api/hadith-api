    "text": "Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ï·º) as say- ing:The Hell and the Paradise fell into dispute and the Hell said: I have been dis- tinguished by the proud and the haughty. And the Paradise said: What is the matter with me that the meek and the humble amongst people and the downtrodden and the simple enter me? Thereupon Allah said to the Paradise: You are (the means) of My Mercy whereby I show mercy to those of My servants whom 1 wish, and He said to the Hell: You are (the means) of punishment whereby 1 punish those of My servants whoml wish. Both of you will be full. The Hell will riot be filled up until Allah puts down His foot in it. The Hell would say: Enough, enough, enough, and at that time it will be filled up, all its parts integrated together",
