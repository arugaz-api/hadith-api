Khattab, and it was said to him:Messenger of Allah. why is it that you put it of immediately. whereupon he said: Gabriel forbade me from it (i. e. wearing of Ods garment), and 'Umar came to him weeping and said: Messenger of Allah you disapproved a thing but you gave it to me. What about me, then? Thereupon be (the Holy Prophet) Wd: I did not give it to you to wear it, but I gave you that you might sell it; and so he (Hadrat Umar) sold it for two thousand dirhams",
