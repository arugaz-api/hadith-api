Then those who were with (him) observed one rak'ah of prayer and they went back and the others came and they observed one rak'ah (with him). Then both the groups completed one rak'ah each. Ibn Umar said: When there is greater danger, then observe prayer even on the ride or with the help of gestures in a standing posture",
