{"author":"Sahih Muslim","hadith":{"hadithnumber":5935,"arabicnumber":0,"text":"Ibn `Abbas reported that Musailima al-Kadhdhab (the greater liar) (who claimed prophethood after the death of the Holy Prophet) came during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) to Medina and said:If Muhammad assigns his caliphate to me after him I would follow him, and there came along with him a large body of persons of his tribe, and there came to him Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) along with Thabit b. Qais b. Shammas and the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) had a piece of wood in his hand until he came in front of Musailima in the company of his companions and said: If you were to ask even this (wood), I would never give it to you. I am not going to do anything against the will of God in your case, and if you turn away (from what I say) Allah will destroy you. And I find you in the same state which I was shown (in the dream) and here is Thabit and he would answer you on my behalf. He (the Holy Prophet) then went back. Ibn `Abbas said: I asked the (meaning of the) words of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ): \"You are the same what I was made to see about you in my dream.\" and Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: While I was sleeping I saw in my hands two gold bangles. This had a disturbing effect upon me and I was given a suggestion in the sleep that I should blow over them, so I blew over them and they were no more. And I interpreted these (two bangles) as the two great liars who would appear after me and the one amongst them was Al-`Anasi the inhabitant of San`a' and the other one Musailima the inhabitant of Yamama","grades":[],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0}}}
