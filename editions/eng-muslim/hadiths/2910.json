    "text": "A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said:We went with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. We entered into the state of Ihram for Umra. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Who has the sacrificial animal with him, he should put on Ihram for Hajj along with Umra. and should not put it off till he has completed them (both Hajj and Umra). She said: When I came to Mecca. I was having menses, I neither circumambulated the House, nor ran between as-safa' and al-Marwa. I complained about it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: Undo your hair, comb it, and pronounce Talbiya for Hajj, and give up Umra (for the time being), which I did. When we had performed the Hajj, the Messenger of Allah (way peace he upon him) sent me with Abd al-Rabman b. Abu Bakr to Tan'im saying: This is the place for your Umra. Those who had put on Ihram for Umra circumambulated the House, and ran between al-safa' and al-Marwa. They then put off Ihram and then made the last circuit after they had returned from Mina after performing their Hajj, but those who had combined the Hajj and the Umra made only one circuit (as they had combined Hajj and 'Umra)",
