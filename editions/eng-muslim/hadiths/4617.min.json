Abu Ishaq) who said:I heard from Bara' who was asked by a man from the Qais tribe: Did you run away from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the Day of Hunain? Bara' said: But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not run away. On that day Banu Hawzzin took part in the battle as archers (on the side of the disbelievers). When we attacked them, they retreated and we fell upon the booty; (they rallied) and advanced towards us with arrows. (At that time) I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith was holding its bridle. He (the Messenger of Allah was saying: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am a descendant of 'Abd al-Muttalib)","grades":[],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":99}}}
