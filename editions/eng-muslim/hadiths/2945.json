    "text": "Musa b. Nafi reported:I came to Mecca as a Mutamattil for Umra (performing Umra first and then putting off Ihram and again entering into the state of Ihram for Hajj) four days before the day of Tarwiya (i. e. on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja). Thereupon the people said: Now yours is the Hajj of the Meccans. I went to 'Ata' b. Abi Rabah and asked his religious verdict. Ata' said: Jabir b. 'Abdullah al'Ansari (Allah be pleased with them) narrated to me that he performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the year when he took sacrificial animals with him (i.e. during the 10th year of Hijra known as the Farewell Pilgrimage) and they had put on Ihram for Hajj only (as Mufrid). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Put off Ihram and circumambulate the House, and (run) between al-Safa and al-Marwa, and get your hair cut and stay as non-Muhrims. When it was the day of Tarwiya, then put on Ihram for Hajj and make lhram for Mut'a (you had put on Ihram for Hajj, but take it off after performing Umra and then again put on Ihram for Hajj). They said: How should we make it Mut'a although we entered upon lhram in the name of Hajj? He said: Do whatever I command you to do. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as I have commanded you to do. But it is not permissible for me to put off Ihram till the sacrifice is offered. Then they also did accordingly",
