{"author":"Sahih Muslim","hadith":{"hadithnumber":6541,"arabicnumber":2564.01,"text":"Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ï·º) as saying:Don't nurse grudge and don't bid him out for raising the price and don't nurse aversion or enmity and don't enter into a transaction when the others have entered into that transaction and be as fellow-brothers and servants of Allah. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He neither oppresses him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him. The piety is here, (and while saying so) he pointed towards his chest thrice. It is a serious evil for a Muslim that he should look down upon his brother Muslim. All things of a Muslim are inviolable for his brother in faith: his blood, his wealth and his honour","grades":[],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":40}}}
