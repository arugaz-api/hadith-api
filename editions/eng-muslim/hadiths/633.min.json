Shu'ba reported it on the authority of his father that he said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lagged behind (in a journey) and I also lagged behind along with him. After having relieved himself he said: Have you any water with you? I brought to him a jar of water; he washed his palms, and face, and when he tried to get his forearms out (he could not) for the sleeve of the gown was tight. He, therefore, brought them out from under the gown and, throwing it over his shoulders, he washed his forearm. He then wiped his forelock and his turban and his socks. He then mounted and I also mounted (the ride) and came to the people. They had begun the prayer with 'Abd ar-Rabmin b. 'Anf leading them and had completed a rak'a. When he perceived the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) he began to retire. He (the Holy Prophet) signed to him to continue and offered prayer along with them. Then when he had pronounced the salutation, the Apostle (ﷺ) got up and I also got up with him, and we offered the rak'a which had been finished before we came","grades":[],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":100}}}
