I said: I am amongst the people also (and have thus every right to listen to the things pertaining to religion). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: I shall be your harbinger on the Cistern; therefore, be cautious lest one of you should come (to me) and may be driven away like a stray camel. I would ask the reasons, and it would be said to me: You don't know what innovations they made after you. And I would then also say: Be away","grades":[],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":35}}}
