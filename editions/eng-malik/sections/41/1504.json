    "text": "Malik related to me from Yaqub ibn Zayd ibn Talha from his father Zayd ibn Talha that Abdullah ibn Abi Mulayka informed him that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and informed him that she had committed adultery and was pregnant. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, \"Go away until you give birth.\" When she had given birth, she came to him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to her, \"Go away until you have suckled and weaned the baby.\" When she had weaned the baby, she came to him. He said, \"Go and entrust the baby to someone.\" She entrusted the baby to someone and then came to him. He gave the order and she was stoned",
