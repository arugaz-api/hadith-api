Whichever categories of people are in most need and are most numerous are given preference, according to how the man in charge sees fit. It is possible that that may change after one year, or two, or more, but it is always those who are in need and are most numerous that are given preference, whatever category they may belong to. This is what I have seen done by people of knowledge with which I am satisifed.\" Malik said, \"There is no fixed share for the collector of the zakat, except according to what the imam sees fit","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":27}}}
