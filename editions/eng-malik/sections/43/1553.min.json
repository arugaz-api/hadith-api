For those who had gold, he made it one thousand dinars. and for those who had silver he made it ten thousand dirhams. Malik said, \"The people of gold are the people of ash-Sham and the people of Egypt. The people of silver are the people of Iraq \" Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that the blood-money was divided into instalments over three or four years. Malik said, \"Three is the most preferable to me of what I have heard on that.\" Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things in our community is that camels are not accepted from the people of cities for blood-money nor is gold or silver accepted from the desert people. Silver is not accepted from the people of gold and gold is not accepted from the people of silver","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":2}}}
