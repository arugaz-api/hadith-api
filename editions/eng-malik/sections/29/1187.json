    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that Said ibn al-Musayyab and Sulayman ibn Yasar and Ibn Shihab all said that a woman who divorced for a compensation had the same idda as a divorced woman - three periods. Malik said that a woman who ransomed herself could not return to her husband except by a new marriage. If someone married her and then separated from her before he had intercourse with her, there was no idda against her from the recent marriage, and she rested on her first idda. Malik said, \"That is the best that I have heard on the matter.\" Malik said, \"If, when a woman offers to compensate her husband, he divorces her straightaway, then that compensation is confirmed for him. If he makes no response, and then at a later date, does divorce her, he is not entitled to that compensation",
