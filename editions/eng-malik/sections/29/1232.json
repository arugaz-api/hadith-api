    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that Abdullah ibn Masud said that there was nothing binding on someone who said, \"Every woman I marry is divorced,\" if he did not name a specific tribe or woman. Malik said, \"That is the best of what I have heard.\" Malik said about a man saying to his wife, \"You are divorced, and every woman I marry is divorced,\" or that all his property would be sadaqa if he did not do such-and-such, and he broke his oath:\"As for his wives, it is divorce as he said, and as for his statement, 'Every woman I marry is divorced', if he did not name a specific woman, tribe, or land, or such, it is not binding on him and he can marry as he wishes. As for his property, he gives a third of it away as sadaqa",
