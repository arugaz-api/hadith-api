He called a slave-girl of his and said, \"Tell them.\" She was embarrassed. He said, \"It is alright, and I do it myself.\" Malik said, \"A man does not practise coitus interruptus with a free woman unless she gives her permission. There is no harm in practising coitus interruptus with a slave-girl without her permission. Someone who has someone else's slave-girl as a wife, does not practise coitus interruptus with her unless her people give him permission","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":59}}}
