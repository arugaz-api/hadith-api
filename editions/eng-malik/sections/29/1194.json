Go to Abdullah ibn Abbas and Abu Hurayra. I left them with A'isha. Ask them and then come and tell us.\" He went and asked them. Ibn Abbas said to Abu Hurayra, \"Give an opinion, Abu Hurayra! A difficult one has come to you.\" Abu Hurayra said, \"One pronouncement separates her and three makes her haram until she has married another husband.\" Ibn Abbas said the like of that. Malik said, \"That is what is done among us, and when a man marries a woman who has been married before, and he has not had intercourse with her, she is treated as a virgin - one pronouncement separates her and three make her haram until she has married another husband",
