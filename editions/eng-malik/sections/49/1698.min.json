He ordered that some barley that was in the house be prepared and he got up to slaughter a sheep for them. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Leave the one with milk.\" He slaughtered a sheep for them and brought them sweet water and it was hung on a palm-tree.
