He said, 'Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah and His blessing' (as-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu), and then he added something more to that. Ibn Abbas said (and at that time his eyesight had gone), 'Who is this?' People said, 'This is a Yemeni who has come to see you,' and they introduced him. Ibn Abbas said, 'The greeting ends with the word blessing.' \" Yahya said that Malik was asked, \"Does one greet a woman?\" He said, \"As for an old woman, I do not disapprove of it. As for a young woman, I do not like it",
