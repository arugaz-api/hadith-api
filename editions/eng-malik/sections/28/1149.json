    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that Rafi ibn Khadij married the daughter of Muhammad ibn Maslama al-Ansari. She was with him until she grew older, and then he married a young girl and preferred the young girl to her. She begged him to divorce her, so he divorced her and then he gave her time until she had almost finished her idda period and then he returned and still preferred the young girl. She therefore asked him to divorce her. He divorced her once, and then returned to her, and still preferred the young girl, and she asked him to divorce her. He said, \"What do you want? There is only one divorce left. If you like, continue and put up with what you see of preference, and if you like, I will separate from you.\" She said, \"I will continue in spite of the preference.\" He kept her in spite of that. Rafi did not see that he had done any wrong action when she remained with him in spite of preference",
