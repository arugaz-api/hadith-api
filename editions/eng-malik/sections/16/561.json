O Allah, reward me in my misfortune and give me better than it afterwards,' Allah will do that for him\" (Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajiun. Allahumma' jurniy fi musiybatiy, wa a qibhiy khayran minha, illa faala 'llahu dhalika bihi.). Umm Salama said, \"When Abu Salama died I said that, and then I said, 'Who is better than Abu Salama?' \" And then Allah left her the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he married her",
