Ibn Abi Amra went and sat down beside him and Uthman asked him who he was, so he told him. Uthman said, \"What have you memorised of the Qur'an?\", and he told him. Uthman said, \"If someone is present at isha, it is as if he had stood in prayer for half a night, and if some one is present at subh, it is as if he had stood in prayer for a whole night","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":8}}}
