He also said, \"If people knew what there was in the call to prayer and the first row, and they could find no other way except to draw lots for it, they would draw lots for it. And if they knew what there was in doing dhuhr at its time, they would race each other to it. And if they knew what there was in the prayers of isha and maghrib, they would come to them even if they had to crawl","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":6}}}
