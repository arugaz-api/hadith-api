Malik said, \"That is what is done in our community. It is by the word of Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, 'And those who accuse women who are muhsan, and then do not bring four witnesses, flog them with eighty lashes, and do not accept any testimony of theirs ever. They indeed are evil-doers, save those who turn in tawba after that and make amends. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.' \" (Sura 24 ayat)","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":6}}}
