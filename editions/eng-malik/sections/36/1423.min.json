Two men came and each of them claimed a woman's child. Umar ibn al-Khattab summoned a person who scrutinized features and he looked at them. The scrutinizer said, \"They both share in him.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab hit him with a whip. Then he summoned the woman, and said, \"Tell me your tale.\" She said, \"It was this one (indicating one of the two men) who used to come to me while I was with my people's camels. He did not leave me until he thought and I thought that I was pregnant. Then he left me, and blood flowed from me, and this other one took his place. I do not know from which of them the child is.\" The scrutinizer said, \"Allah is greater.\" Umar said to the child, \"Go to whichever of them you wish","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":25}}}
