{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1309,"arabicnumber":1309,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik from Abu'r-Rijal, Muhammad ibn Abdar-Rahman ibn Haritha that his mother, Amra bint Abd ar-Rahman used to sell her fruit and keep some of it aside. Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing things among us is that when a man sells the fruit of his orchard, he can keep aside up to a third of the fruit, but that is not to be exceeded. There is no harm in what is less than a third.\" Malik added that he thought there was no harm for a man to sell the fruit of his orchard and keep aside only the fruit of a certain palm-tree or palm-trees which he had chosen and whose number he had specified, because the owner was only keeping aside certain fruit of his own orchard and everything else he sold","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":20}}}
