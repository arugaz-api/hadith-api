{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1037,"arabicnumber":1037,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik from Umara ibn Yasar that Ata ibn Yasar told him that Abu Ayyub al-Ansari had told him, \"We used to sacrifice one sheep, and a man sacrificed for himself and his family. Then later on people began to compete with each other and it became boasting.\" Malik said, \"The best that I have heard about a single camel, cow or sheep, is that a man should sacrifice a camel for himself and his family. He sacrifices a cow or sheep which he owns for his family, and shares with them in it. It is disapproved for a group of people to buy a camel, cow or sheep, to share for the ritual and sacrifices, each man giving a share of its price, and taking a share of its meat. We have heard the tradition that people do not share in the ritual. However, it may be that the people of one household can share","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":10}}}
