{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":860,"arabicnumber":860,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said that he heard Said ibn al-Musayyab asking a group of people, \"What do you think about someone who has intercourse with his wife while he is in ihram?\" and none of them answered him. Said said, \"There is a man who has had intercourse with his wife while in ihram who has sent a message to Madina asking about it.\" Some of them said, \"They should be kept apart until a future year,\" and Said ibn al-Musayyab said, \"They should carry on and complete the hajj which they have spoiled, and then return home when they have finished. If another hajj comes upon them, they must do hajj and sacrifice an animal. They should go into ihram at the same place where they went into ihram for the hajj that they spoiled, and they should keep apart until they have finished their hajj.\" Malik said, \"They should both sacrifice an animal.\" Malik said, about a man who had intercourse with his wife during hajj after he had come down from Arafa but before he had stoned the Jamra, \"He must sacrifice an animal and do hajj again in another year. If, however, he had intercourse with his wife after he stoned the Jamra, he only has to do an umra and sacrifice an animal and he does not have to do another hajj.\" Malik said, \"What spoils a hajj or an umra and makes sacrificing an animal and repeating the hajj necessary is the meeting of the two circumcised parts, even if there is no emission. It is also made necessary by an emission if it is the result of bodily contact. I do not think that a man who remembers something and has an emission owes anything, and if a man were to kiss his wife and no emission were to occur from that, he would only have to sacrifice an animal. A woman in ihram who has intercourse with her husband several times during hajj or umra out of obedience to him only has to do another hajj and sacrifice an animal. That is if her husband has intercourse with her while she is doing hajj. If he has intercourse with her while she is doing umra, she must repeat the umra she has spoiled and sacrifice an animal","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":156}}}
