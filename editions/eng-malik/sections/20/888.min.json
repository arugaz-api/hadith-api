Malik said, \"No-one is permitted to shave his head until he has killed his sacrificial animal, and no-one must sacrifice before dawn on the day of sacrifice. The things that should be done on the day of sacrifice are slaughtering, donning clothes, grooming the body generally (at-tafath) and shaving the head, and none of this may be done before the day of sacrifice","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":184}}}
