    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he asked Abd ar-Rahman ibn Qasim, \"From where did Qasim stonethe jamrat al-Aqaba?\"and he replied, \"From wherever it was possible.\" Yahya said that Malik was asked whether some one else could throw the stones for a child or a sick man and he said, \"Yes, and a sick man should inquire as to when the stones will be thrown for him and then say the takbir while he is in the place where he is staying, bleeding. If a sick man regains his health during the days of tashriq, he should stone whatever stoning has been done for him and he must offer a sacrificial animal.\" Malik said, \"I do not consider that someone who stones the jamras or does say between Safa and Marwa without being in wudu has to repeat anything, but he should not make a general practice of it",
