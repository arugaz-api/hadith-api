Then they asked him again, and he gave to them until he used up what he had. Then he said, \"What wealth I have, I will not hoard from you. Whoever has forbearance, Allah will help him. Whoever tries to be independent, Allah will enrich him. Whoever tries to be patient, Allah will give him patience, and no one is given a better or vaster gift than patience","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":58,"hadith":7}}}
