If I am killed in the way of Allah, expectant for reward, sincere, advancing, and not retreating, will Allah pardon my faults?\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Yes.\" When the man turned away, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called him - or commanded him and he was called to him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, \"What did you say?\" He repeated his words to him, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him, \"Yes, except for the debt. Jibril said that to me","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":31}}}
