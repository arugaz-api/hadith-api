    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik from Hisham ibn Urwa that his father said that Abasa (Sura 80) was sent down about Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum. He came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and began to say, \"O Muhammad, show me a place near you (where I can sit),\" whilst one of the leading men of the idol worshippers was in audience with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began to turn away from him and give his attention to the other man, and he said to him, \"Father of so-and-so, do you see any harm in what I am saying?\" and he said, \"No, by the blood (of our sacrifices) I see no harm in what you are saying.\" And Abasa - \"He frowned and turned away when the blind man came\" - was sent down",
