    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that Abdullah ibn Abdullah ibn Jabir ibn Atik said that Abdullah ibn Umar had come to them in Bani Muawiya, one of the villages of the Ansar, and said, \"Do you know where the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed in this mosque of yours? \"I told him, \"Yes,\" and I pointed out a place near where he was. He said, \"Do you know the three things for which he made dua here?\" I said \"Yes.\" He said, \"Tell me them then.\" I said, \"He asked that He would not make an enemy from among the non- believers triumph over the believers and that He would not destroy the believers by bad harvests, and he was given both these things. And he asked that He would not make the believers fight among themselves, and that was refused.\" Ibn Umar said, \"You have told the truth,\" and he added, \"Turmoil will not cease until the day of rising",
