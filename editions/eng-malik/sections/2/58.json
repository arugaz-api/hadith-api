Our brothers are those who have not yet come. And I will precede them to the Hawd. (The Hawd:the watering place of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from which he will give to the people of his community on the day of rising.)\" They asked him, \"Messenger of Allah! How will you recognise those of your community who come after you?\" He said, \"Doesn't a man who has horses with white legs and white blazes on their foreheads among totally black horses recognise which ones are his own?\" They said, \"Of course, Messenger of Allah.\" He went on, \"Even so will they come on the day of rising with white marks on their foreheads, hands and feet from wudu, and I will precede them to the Hawd. Some men will be driven away from the Hawd as if they were straying camels and I shall call out to them, 'Will you not come? Will you not come? Will you not come?' and someone will say, 'They changed things after you,' so I shall say, 'Then away with them, away with them, away with them",
