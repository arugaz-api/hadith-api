She would criticise them for this saying, \"Women never used to do this,\" i.e. in the time of the companions. Malik was asked whether a woman whose period had finished could do tayammum to purify herself if she could not find waterand he said, \"Yes, because she is like some one in a state of major ritual impurity, who, if he cannot find water, does tayammum","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Daif"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":98}}}
