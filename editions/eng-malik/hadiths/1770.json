When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw it, he stopped at the door and did not enter. She recognised disapproval on his face and said, \"Messenger of Allah, I turn in repentance to Allah and His Messenger. What have I done wrong?\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"What is the meaning of this cushion?\" She said, \"I bought it for you to sit and recline on.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Those who make such pictures will be punished on the Day of Rising. It will be said to them, 'Bring to life what you have created'. Then he said, 'The angels do not enter a house in which there are pictures",
