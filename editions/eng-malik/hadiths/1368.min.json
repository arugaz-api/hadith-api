{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1368,"arabicnumber":1368,"text":"Malik related to me that Zayd ibn Aslam said, \"Usury in the Jahiliyya was that a man would give a loan to a man for a set term. When the term was due, he would say, 'Will you pay it off or increase me?' If the man paid, he took it. If not, he increased him in his debt and lengthened the term for him .\" Malik said, \"The disapproved of way of doing things about which there is no dispute among us, is that a man should give a loan to a man for a term, and then the demander reduce it and the one from whom it is demanded pay it in advance. To us that is like someone who delays repaying his debt after it is due to his creditor and his creditor increases his debt.\" Malik said, \"This is nothing else but usury. No doubt about it.\" Malik spoke about a man who loaned one hundred dinars to a man for two terms. When it was due, the person who owed the debt said to him, \"Sell me some goods, whose price is one hundred dinars in cash for one hundred and fifty on credit.\" Malik said, \"This transaction is not good, and the people of knowledge still forbid it.\" Malik said, \"This is disapproved of because the creditor himself gives the debtor the price of what the man sells him, and he defers repayment of the hundred of the first transaction for the debtor for the term which is mentioned to him in the second transaction, and the debtor increases him with fifty dinars for his deferring him. That is disapproved of and it is not good. It also resembles the hadith of Zayd ibn Aslam about the transactions of the people of the Jahiliyya. When their debts were due, they said to the person with the debt, 'Either you pay in full or you increase it.' If they paid, they took it, and if not they increased debtors in their debts, and extended the term for them","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":30}}}
