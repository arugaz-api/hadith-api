    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that Abu'z-Zubayr al-Makki said, \"I saw the House deserted both after subh and asr, with no-one doing tawaf.\" Malik said, \"If someone does some of his circuits and then the subh or asr prayer is begun, he should pray with the imam and then complete the rest of his circuits but should not pray at all until the sun has either risen or set \" He added, \"There is no harm in delaying the two rakas until after he has prayed maghrib.\" Malik said, \"There is no harm in someone doing a single tawaf after subh or after asr, not to do more than one group of seven circuits, and then as long as he delays the two rakas until after the sun has risen, as Umar ibn al-Khattab did, or he delays them until after the sun has set if it is after asr. Then when the sun has set he can pray them if he wants, or, if he wants, he can delay them until after he has prayed maghrib. There is no harm in that",
