{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":740,"arabicnumber":740,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard the people of knowledge say, \"Women do not have to raise their voices when they are doing talbiya, and a woman should only speak loudly enough to hear herself.\" Malik said, \"Some one who is in ihram should not raise his voice when doing talbiya if he is in a mosque where there are groups of people. He should only speak loudly enough for himself and those who are near him to be able to hear, except in the Masjid alHaram and the mosque at Mina, where he should raise his voice.\" Malik said, \"I have heard some of the people of knowledge recommending (people to do) talbiya at the end of every prayer and at every rise on the route.\" Yahya related to me from Malik, from Abu'l-Aswad Muhammad ibn Abd ar-Rahman, fromUrwa ibn az-Zubayr, that A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"We set out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the year of the farewell hajj, and some of us went into ihram to do umra, some of us went into ihram to do hajj and umra, and some of us went into ihram to do hajj on its own. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went into ihram to do hajj on its own. Those who had gone into ihram to do umra came out of ihram (after doing umra). Those who had gone into ihram to do hajj (on its own), or to do both hajj and umra, did not come out of ihram until the day of the sacrifice","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":36}}}
