{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":663,"arabicnumber":663,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik from Hisham ibn Urwa that his father used to be cupped while he was fasting and he would not then break his fast. Hisham added, \"I only ever saw him being cupped when he was fasting.\" Malik said, \"Cupping is only disapproved of for some one who is fasting out of fear that he will become weak and if it were not for that, it would not be disapproved of. I do not think that a man who is cupped in Ramadan and does not break his fast, owes anything, and I do not say that he has to make up for the day on which he was cupped, because cupping is only disapproved of for someone fasting if his fast is endangered. I do not think that someone who is cupped, and is then well enough to keep the fast until evening, owes anything, nor does he have to make up for that day","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":18,"hadith":34}}}
