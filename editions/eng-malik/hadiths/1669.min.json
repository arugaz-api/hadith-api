Umar said, \"Messenger of Allah, do you clothe me in it when you said what you said about the robe of Utarid?\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"I did not give it to you to wear.\" Umar gave it to a brother of his in Makka who was still an idolater","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":19}}}
