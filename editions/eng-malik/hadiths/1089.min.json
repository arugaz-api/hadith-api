The siblings by the mother had their rights. The rest was inherited by the former masters of the mother if she was a freed slave. If she was a free woman by origin, she inherited her due and the siblings by the mother inherited their due, and the rest went to the Muslims. Malik said, \"I heard the same as that from Sulayman ibn Yasar.\" Malik said, \"That is what I saw the people of knowledge in our city doing","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Daif"}],"reference":{"book":27,"hadith":16}}}
