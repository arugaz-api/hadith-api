When he had finished he went up to the people and said, 'Do you know what your Lord has said?' They said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'Some of my slaves have begun the morning believing in Me, and others have begun it rejecting Me.

But as for those who say, 'We were rained on by such and such a star, they reject Me and believe in the stars",
