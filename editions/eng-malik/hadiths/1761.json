At-Tufayl said, \"I came to Abdullah ibn Umar one day and he asked me to follow him to the market. I said to him, 'What will you do in the market if you will not stop to sell nor seek any goods or barter with them or sit in any of the assemblies or market?' Abdullah ibn Umar said that we should sit down and talk, and then he explained, 'Abu Batni, (lit. father of the belly, at- Tufayl had a prominent stomach), we go out in the morning only for the sake of the greeting. We greet whomever we meet",
