{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":727,"arabicnumber":727,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr and Rabia ibn Abi Abd ar-Rahman that al-Walid ibn Abd al- Malik asked Salim ibn Abdullah and Kharija ibn Zayd ibn Thabit if he could use perfume after he had stoned the jamra and shaved his head, but before he had left for the tawafal-ifada. Salim forbade him to do so, but Kharija ibn Zayd ibn Thabit said that he could. Malik said, \"There is no harm in a man oiling himself with an oil which does not have any perfume in it, either before he enters ihram, or before he leaves Mina for the tawaf al-ifada, if he has stoned the jamra.\" Yahya said that Malik was asked whether someone in ihram could eat food with saffron in it, and he said, \"There is no harm in some one in ihram eating it if it has been cooked. If, however, it has not been cooked he should not eat it","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":23}}}
