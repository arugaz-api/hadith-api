The imam uses ijtihad in it, and there is no generally agreed on way of doing things in our community about it.\" Malik said, \"What is done in our community about the wound to the brain and the wound which splinters the bone, and the wound that bares the bone is that they apply only to the head and face. Whatever of that occurs in the body only has ijtihad in it.\" Malik said, \"I do not think the lower jaw and the nose are part of the head in their injury because they are separate bones, and except for them the head is one bone","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":18}}}
