{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1501,"arabicnumber":1501,"text":"Malik related to me from Yahya ibn Said from Said ibn al-Musayyab that a man from the Aslam tribe came to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said to him, \"I have committed adultery.\" Abu Bakr said to him, \"Have you mentioned this to anyone else?\" He said, \"No.\" Abu Bakr said to him, \"Then cover it up with the veil of Allah. Allah accepts tawba from his slaves.\" His self was still unsettled, so he went to Umar ibn al- Khattab. He told him the same as he had said to Abu Bakr, and Umar told him the same as Abu Bakr had said to him. His self was still not settled so he went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said to him, \"I have committed adultery,\" insistently. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, turned away from him three times. Each time the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, turned away from him until it became too much. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, questioned his family, \"Does he have an illness which affects his mind, or is he mad?\" They said, \"Messenger of Allah, by Allah, he is well.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Unmarried or married?\" They said, \"Married, Messenger of Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the order and he was stoned","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":41,"hadith":2}}}
