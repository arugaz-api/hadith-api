{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1438,"arabicnumber":1438,"text":"Malik related to me from Hisham ibn Urwa from his father from Yahya ibn Abd ar-Rahman ibn Hatib that some slaves of Hatib stole a she-camel belonging to a man from the Muzayna tribe and they slaughtered it. The case was brought before Umar ibn al-Khattab, and Umar ordered Kathir ibn as-Salt to cut off their hands. Then Umar said to Habib, \"I think you must be starving them,\" and he added, \"By Allah! I will make you pay such a fine that it will be heavy for you.\" He enquired of the man from the Muzayna tribe, \"What was the price of your camel?\" The Muzayni said, \"By Allah, I refused to sell her for 400 dirhams.'' Umar said, ''Give him 800 dirhams.\" Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"Doubling the price is not the behaviour of our community. What people have settled on among us is that the man is obliged to pay the value of the camel or animal on the day he took it","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":40}}}
