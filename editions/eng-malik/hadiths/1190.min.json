The rest was inherited by the owners of his mother's wala' if she was a freed slave. If she was an ordinary free woman, she inherited her right, his maternal brothers inherited their rights, and the rest went to the Muslims. Malik said,\"I heard the same as that from Sulayman ibn Yasar, and it is what I saw the people of knowledge in our city doing","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Daif"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":14}}}
