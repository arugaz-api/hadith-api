{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1467,"arabicnumber":1467,"text":"Malik related to me that he heard Ibn Shihab say, \"The precedent of the sunna is that when a slave is freed, his property follows him.\" Malik said, \"One thing which makes clear that the property of a slave follows him when he is freed is that when the contract (mukatab) is written for his freedom, his property follows him even if he did not stipulate it. That is because the bond of kitaba is the bond of wala' when it is complete. The property of a slave and a mukatab is not treated in the same way as any children they may have. Their children are only treated in the same way as their own slaves, not in the same way as their property. This is because the sunna, in which there is no dispute, is that when a slave is freed, his property follows him and his children do not follow him, and when a mukatab writes the contract for his freedom, his property follows him and his children do not follow him.\" Malik said, \"One thing which makes that clear is that when a slave or a mukatab are bankrupt, their property is taken but the mothers of their children and their children are not taken because they are not their property.\" Malik said, \"Another thing which makes it clear is that when a slave is sold and the person who buys him stipulates the inclusions of his property, his children are not included in his property.\" Malik said, \"Another thing which makes it clear is that when a slave does injure some one, he and his property are taken, and his children are not taken","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":38,"hadith":4}}}
