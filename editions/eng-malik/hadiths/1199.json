    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard Ibn Shihab say, \"When a man who is terminally ill divorces his wife three times, she inherits from him.\" Malik said, \"If he divorces her while he is terminally ill before he has consummated the marriage, she has half of the bride-price and inherits, and she does not have to do an idda. If he consummated the marriage, she has all the dowry and inherits. The virgin and the previously married woman are the same in this situation according to us",
