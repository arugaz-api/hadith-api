    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik from Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Qasim from his father that A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave Hafsa bint Abd arRahman in marriage to al-Mundhir ibn az-Zubayr while Abd ar-Rahman was away in Syria. When Abd ar-Rahman arrived, he said, \"Shall someone like me have this done to him? Am I the kind of man to have something done to him without his consent?\" A'isha spoke to al-Mundhir ibn az-Zubayr, and al-Mundhir said, \"It is in the hands of Abd ar-Rahman.\" Abd ar-Rahman said, \"I won't oppose something that you have already completed.\" Hafsa was confirmed with al-Mundhir, and there was no divorce",
