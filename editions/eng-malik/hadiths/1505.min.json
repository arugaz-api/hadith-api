One of them said, \"Messenger of Allah! Judge between us by the Book of Allah!\" The other said, and he was the wiser of the two, \"Yes, Messenger of Allah. Judge between us by the Book of Allah and give me permission to speak.\" He said, \"Speak.\" He said, \"My son was hired by this person and he committed fornication with his wife. He told me that my son deserved stoning, and I ransomed him for one hundred sheep and a slave-girl. Then I asked the people of knowledge and they told me that my son deserved to be flogged with one hundred lashes and exiled for a year, and they informed me that the woman deserved to be stoned.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"By him in whose Hand myself is, I will judge between you by the Book of Allah. As for your sheep and slave girl, they should be returned to you.
