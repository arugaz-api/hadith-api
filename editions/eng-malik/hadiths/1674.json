He said, 'O Lord! What is this?' Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, said, 'It is dignity, Ibrahim.' He said, 'Lord, increase me in dignity!' \" Yahya said that he had heard Malik say, \"One takes from the moustache until the edge of the lip appears, that is the rim. One does not cut if off completely so that one mutilates oneself",
