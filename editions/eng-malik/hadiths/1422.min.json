{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1422,"arabicnumber":1422,"text":"Malik related to me from Yazid ibn Abdullah ibn al-Hadi from Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn al-Harith at-Taymi from Sulayman ibn Yasar from Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya that a woman's husband died, and she did the idda of four months and ten days. Then she married when she was free to marry. She stayed with her husband for four and a half months, then gave birth to a fully developed child. Her husband went to Umar ibn al-Khattab and mentioned that to him, so Umar called some of the old women of the Jahiliyya and asked them about that. One of the women said, \"I will tell you what happened with this woman. When her husband died, she was pregnant by him, but then the blood flowed from her because of his death and the child became dry in her womb. When her new husband had intercourse with her and the water reached the child, the child moved in the womb and grew.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab believed her and separated them (until she had completed her idda). Umar said, \"Only good has reached me about you two,\" and he connected the child to the first husband","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":24}}}
