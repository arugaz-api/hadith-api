He asked him again, but he did not answer him. Then he asked him again, and again he did not answer him. Umar said, \"May your mother be bereaved of you, Umar. Three times you have importuned the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a question and he has not answered you at all.\" Umar continued, \"I got my camel moving until, when I was in front of the people, I feared that a piece of Qur'an was being sent down about me. It was not long before I heard a crier calling for me, and I said that I feared that a piece of Qur'an had been sent down about me.\" He continued, \"I came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Peace be upon you' to him, and he said, 'A sura has been sent down to me this night that is more beloved to me than anything on which the sun rises.' Then he recited al-Fath (Sura)","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":9}}}
