He summoned one of the desert people and he began to eat and follow the grease in the dish with a morsel of bread. Umar said, \"It is as if you were poor.\" He said, \"By Allah. I have not eaten ghee nor have I seen food with it since such- and-such a time.\" Umar declared, \"I shall not eat clarified butter until people are given life again like they were first given life,\" (i.e. on the Day of Rising)",
