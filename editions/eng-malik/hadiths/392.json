    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik from Abu Hazim Salama ibn Dinar from Sahl ibn Said as-Saidi that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to the tribe of Bani Amr ibn Awf to settle their disputes .The time for the prayer came and the muadhdhin came to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, \"Could you lead the people in prayer and I will say the iqama?\" He said, \"Yes,\" and Abu Bakr prayed. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came back while the people were praying, and approached and joined the row. People clapped, but Abu Bakr did not turn round. The people increased their clapping, and Abu Bakr turned round and saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, indicated to him to stay in his place. Abu Bakr raised his hands and praised Allah that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had told him to do that. Then he drew back until he was in the row, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stepped forward and led the prayer. When he had finished he said, \"Abu Bakr, what stopped you from staying put like I told you?\" Abu Bakr said, \"It is not for Ibn Abi Quhafa to pray in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Why did I see you all clapping so much? If something happens to you in the prayer you should say 'Subhana-llah' (Glory be to Allah), and when you say 'Subhana-llah' you will be heard. Clapping is only for women",
