Then when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to Madina he fasted it and ordered that it be fasted. Then Ramadan was made obligatory, and that became the fard instead of Ashura, but whoever wanted to, fasted it, and whoever did not want to, did not fast it","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":18,"hadith":35}}}
