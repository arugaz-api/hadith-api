{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1560,"arabicnumber":1560,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard Ibn Shihab say, \"The precedent of the sunna when a man injures a woman is that he must pay the blood- money for that injury and there is no retaliation against him.\" Malik said, \"That is an accidental injury, when a man strikes a woman and hits with a blow what he did not intend, for instance, if he struck her with a whip and cut her eye open and the like of that.\" Malik said about a woman who has a husband and children who are not from her paternal relatives or her people, that since he is from another tribe, there is no blood-money against her husband for her criminal action, nor any against her children if they are not from her people, nor any against her maternal brothers when they are not from her paternal relations or her people. These are entitled to her inheritance but only the paternal relations have paid blood-money from since the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Until today it is like that with the mawla of a woman. The inheritance they leave goes to the children of the woman even if they are not from her tribe, but the blood-money of the criminal act of the mawla is only against her tribe","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":9}}}
