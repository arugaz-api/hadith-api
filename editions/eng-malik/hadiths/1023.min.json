They thought that that would compensate for them.\" Malik said, \"The best of what I have heard about the one who does kaffara for breaking his oath by clothing people is that if he clothes men he clothes them each in one garment. If he clothes women, he clothes them each in two garments, a long shift and a long scarf, because that is what is satisfactory for each of them in the prayer","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":10}}}
