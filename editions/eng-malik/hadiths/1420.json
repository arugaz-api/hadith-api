Sunayn took him to Umar ibn al-Khattab. He asked, \"What has induced you to take this person?\" He answered, \"I found him lost, so I took him.'' Umar's advisor said to him,' 'Amir al-Muminin! He is a man who does good.\" Umar inquired of him, \"Is it so?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab said, \"Go, he is free, and you have his wala' inheritance, and we will provide for him.\" Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"What is done in our community about an abandoned child is that he is free, and his wala' inheritance belongs to the muslims, and they inherit from him and pay his blood money",
