The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came and I asked him about it. He said, 'He is your paternal uncle, so give him permission.' So I said, 'Messenger of Allah! The woman nursed me not the man.' He said, 'He is your paternal uncle, so let him enter.' \" A'isha said, \"That was after the veil had been imposed on us.\" A'isha added, \"What is haram by birth is made haram by suckling","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":30,"hadith":2}}}
