    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik, from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr ibn Muhammad, that Amra bint 'Abd ar-Rahman told him that Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan once wrote to A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saying, \"'Abdullah ibn Abbas said that whatever was haram for some one doing hajj was also haram for some one who sent a sacrificial animal until the animal was sacrificed. I have sent one, so write and tell me what you say about this, or tell the man in charge of the animal what to do. Amra said that A'isha said, \"It is notas Ibn Abbas has said. I once plaited the garlands for the sacrificial animal of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with my own two hands. Then after that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, himself put the garlands on the animal and then sent it with my father. And there was nothing that Allah had made halal forthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that was haram for him until such time as the animal had been sacrificed",
