{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":546,"arabicnumber":546,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died on Monday and was buried on Tuesday and people prayed over him individually with no one leading them. Some people said that he would be buried near the mimbar, and others said that he would be buried in al-Baqi. Abu Bakr as-Siddiq came and said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'No prophet was ever buried except in the place where he died.' \"So a grave was dug for him there. When he was about to be washed they wished to take off his shirt but they heard a voice saying \"Don't take off his shirt,\" so they did not take off his shirt and he was washed with it on, may Allah bless him and grant him peace","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":27}}}
