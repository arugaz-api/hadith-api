There is nothing known about the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ever telling any of his companions, or anybody else that was with him, to make up for anything they had missed or to go back to doing anything they had not finished doing","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih Lighairihi"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":94}}}
