{"author":"Muwatta Malik","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1135,"arabicnumber":1135,"text":"Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard Rabia ibn Abd ar- Rahman say that a slave could marry four women. Malik said, \"This is the best of what I have heard about the matter.\" Malik said, \"The slave differs with the muhallil if the slave is given permission by his master for his ex-wife. If his master does not give him permission, he separates them. The muhallil is separated in any case if he intends to make the woman halal by marriage.\" Malik said, \"When a slave is owned by his wife or a husband owns his wife, the possession of each of them is rendered void without divorce. If a man, for instance, is married to a slave-girl, and then he buys her, he must divorce her as a matter of course. They can then re- marry. If they re-marry afterwards, that separation was not divorce.\" Malik said, \"When a slave is freed by his wife who owns him and she is in the idda-period from him, they can only return to each other after she has made another marriage","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":45}}}
