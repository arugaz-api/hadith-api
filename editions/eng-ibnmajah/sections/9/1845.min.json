I was sitting near him. Uthman said to him: 'Would you like that I marry you to a young virgin who will remind you of how you were in the past?' When Abdullah saw that he did not say anything to him apart from that, he gestured to me, so I came and he said: 'As you say that the Messenger of Allah said “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one's chastity. Whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it will diminish his desire.” ' ”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Bukhari And Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":1}}}
