He said: 'Cover your 'Awrah, except from your wife and those whom your right hand possesses.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what if the people live close together?' He said: 'If you can make sure that no one sees it, then do not let anyone see it.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what if one of us is alone?' He said: 'Allah is more deserving that you should feel shy before Him than People.' ”",
