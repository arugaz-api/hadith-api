She said: \"I read what is between its two covers 'and I have not found that.\" He said: \"If you read it properly you would have found it. Have you not read the words: 'And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).'?\" She said: \"Of course.\" He said: 'The Messenger of Allah forbade that.\" She said: 'I think that your wife does it.'
