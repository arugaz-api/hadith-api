    "text": "It was narrated that:Mughirah bin Shubah said: “I came to the Prophet and told him of a woman to whom I had to propose marriage. He said: 'Go and look at her, for that is more likely to create love between you.' So I went to a woman among the Ansar and proposed marriage through her parents. I told them what the Prophet had said, and it was as if they did not like that. Then I heard that woman, behind her curtain, say: 'If the Messenger of Allah has told you to do that, then do it, otherwise I adjure you by Allah (not to do so)'. And it was as if she regarded that as a serious matter. So I looked at her and married her.” And he mentioned how well he got along with her",
