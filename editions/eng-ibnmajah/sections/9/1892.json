    "text": "It was narrated that:`Abdullah bin Mas`ud said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was granted a combination of all manner of goodness, as well as its seal,” or he said: “The opening (of the way to) all good. He (ﷺ) taught us the Khutbah of prayer and Khutbah of need. 'The Khutbah of prayer is: At-tahiyyatu lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat. As-salamu `alaika ayyuhan-Nabiyyu was rahmat-ullahi was barakatuhu. As-salamu `alaina wa `ala `ibadillahis-salihin. Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah. Wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa rasuluh (All compliments, prayers and pure words are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah. And I bear witness that Muhammad (ﷺ) is His slave and Messenger). The Khutbah of need is: Al-hamdu lillahi nahmadhu wa nasta`inuhu wa nastaghfiruhu, wa na`udhu billahi min shururi anfusina wa min sayi'ati a`malina, man yahdihillahu fala mudilla lahu, wa man yudlil fala hadiya lahu. Wa ashadu an la ilaha illallahu wahduhu la sharika lahu, wa anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa rasuluhu. (Praise is to Allah, we praise Him and we seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allah from the evil of our own souls and from our bad deeds, Whomsoever Allah guides will never be led astray; and whomsoever is led astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah, alone with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad (ﷺ) is His slave and His Messenger). Then add to your Khutbah the following three verses: 'O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in the state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allah.' And: 'O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you.' And: 'O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins...' until the end of the verse.”",
