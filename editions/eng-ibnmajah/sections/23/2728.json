I had lost consciousness, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed ablution and poured some of the water of his ablution over me. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what should I do? How should I decide about my wealth?’ Until the Verse of inheritance was revealed at the end of An-Nisa’: “If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants or descendents.” [4:12] And: “They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: ‘Allah directs (thus) about those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs.’” [4:]",
