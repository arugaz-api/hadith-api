They said: ‘The daughter gets one half, and what is left goes to the sister. Go to Ibn Mas’ud, for he will concur with what we say.’ So the man went to Ibn Mas’ud, and told him what they had said. ‘Abdullah said: ‘I will go astray and will not be guided (if I say that I agree); but I will judge as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) judged. The daughter gets one half, and the son’s daughter gets one- sixth. That makes two thirds. And what is left goes to the sister.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":3}}}
