One of his family members said:“We hoped that when he died it would be as a martyr in the cause of Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “In that case the martyrs of my nation would be few. Being killed in the cause of Allah is martyrdom; dying of the plague is martyrdom; when a pregnant woman dies in childbirth that is martyrdom; and dying of drowning, or burning, or of pleurisy, is martyrdom.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":51}}}
