When he reached the battle site, or when he was partway there, a group of the army asked permission to take a different route, and he gave them permission, and appointed ‘Abdullah bin Hudhafah bin Qais As-Sahmi as their leader, and I was one of those who fought alongside with him. When we were partway there, the people lit a fire to warm themselves and cook some food. ‘Abdullah, who was a man who liked to joke, said:“Do I not have the right that you should listen to me and obey?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “And if I command you to do something, will you not do it?” They said: “Of course.” He said: “Then I command you to jump into this fire.” Some people got up and got ready to jump, and when he saw that they were about to jump, he said: “Restrain yourselves, for I was joking with you.” When we came to Al-Madinah, they mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever among you commands you to do something that involves disobedience to Allah, do not obey him.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":111}}}
