    "text": "It was narrated from 'Amr bin Shu'aib, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“Whoever is killed by mistake, his blood money in camels is thirty Bint Makhad (a one-year-old she-camel), thirty Bint Labun (a two-year-old she-camel), thirty Hiqqah (a three-year-old she-camel) and ten Bani Labun (two-years-old male-camel).” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to fix the value (of the blood money for accidental killing) among town-dwellers at four hundred Dinar or the equivalent value in silver. When he calculated the price in terms of camels (for Bedouins), it would vary from one time to another. When prices roses, the value (in dinars) would rise: and when prices fell, the value (in Dinar) would fall. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) the value was between four hundred and eight hundred dinar, or the equivalent value in silver, eight thousand Dirham. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ruled that if a person's blood money was paid in cattle, among those who kept cattle, the amount was two hundred cows; and if person's blood money was paid in sheep, among those who kept sheep, the value was two thousand sheep.
