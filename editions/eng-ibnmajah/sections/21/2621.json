He said: 'Woe to him can there be any guidance for him? I heard your Prophet (ﷺ) say: “The killer and his victim will be brought on the day of Resurrection, with slain holding onto the head of his killer, saying: 'O Lord, ask this one, why did he kill me?” By Allah (SWT), Allah (SWT) the Mighty and Sublime revealed it to your Prophet (ﷺ) then He did not abrogate it after He revealed it.”",
