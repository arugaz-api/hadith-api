He scratched in the ground with it, then raised his head and said: 'There is no one among you but his place in Paradise or Hell has already been decreed.' He was asked: 'O Messenger of Allah, should we not then rely upon that?' He said: 'No, strive and do not rely upon that, for it will be made easy for each person to do that for which he was created.' Then he recited: \"As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness). But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient. And denies Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path for evil","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":78}}}
