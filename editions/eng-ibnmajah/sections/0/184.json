He will say: \"Peace be upon you, O people of Paradise.\" This is what Allah says in the Verse: \"Salam (peace be upon you) - a Word from the Lord (Allah), The Most Merciful.\" He will look at them, and they will look at Him, and they will not pay any attention to the delights (of Paradise) so long as they look at Him, until He will screen Himself from them. But His light and blessing will remain with them in their bodies",
