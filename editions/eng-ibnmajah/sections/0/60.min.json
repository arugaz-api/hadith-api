They will say: \" Our Lord! They are our brothers, they used to pray with us, fast with us and perform Hajj with us, and you have admitted them to Hell.\" He will say: \"Go and bring forth those whom you recognize among them.\" So they will come to them , and they will recognize them by their faces. The Fire will not consume their faces, although there will be some whom the Fire will seize halfway up their shins, and others whom it will seize up to their ankles. They will bring them forth, and will say. \"Our Lord, we have brought forth those whom You commanded us to bring forth.\" Then He will say: \"Bring forth those who have a Dinar's weight of faith in their hearts, then those who have half a Dinar's weight in their hearts, then those who have a mustard-seed's weight.\" Abu Sa'eed said. :\"He who does not believe this, let him recite, 'Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a small ant), but is there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":60}}}
