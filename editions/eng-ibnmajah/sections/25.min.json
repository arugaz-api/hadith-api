When he reached me, I said: ‘I am Muhammad bin ‘Ali bin Husain.’ He stretched forth his hand towards my head, and undid my top button, then undid my lower button. Then he placed his hand on my chest, and I was a young boy at that time. Then he said: ‘Welcome to you, ask whatever you want.’ So I asked him, and he was blind. The time for prayer came, so he stood up, wrapping himself in a woven cloth. Every time he put it on his shoulders, its edges came up, because it was too small. And his cloak was beside him on a hook. He led us in prayer, then he said: ‘Tell us about the Hajj of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ He held up his hands, showing nine (fingers), and said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stayed for nine years without performing Hajj, then it was announced to the people in the tenth year that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was going for Hajj. So many people came to Al-Madinah, all of them seeking to follow the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do what he did. He set out and we set out with him, and we came to Dhul-Hulaifah where Asma’ bint ‘Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abu Bakr. She sent word to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asking what she should do. He said: “Perform Ghusl, fasten a cloth around your waist and enter Ihram.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed in the mosque, then he rode Qaswa’ (his she-camel) until, when his she-camel arose with him upon Baida’,’ Jabir said: ‘As far as I could see, I saw people riding and walking in front of him, and I saw the same to his right and left, and behind him, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was among us and Qur’an was being revealed to him, and he understood its meaning. Whatever he did, we did too. Then he began the Talbiyah of monotheism: “Labbaika Allahumma labbaik, labbaika la sharika laka labbaik. Innal-hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal-mulk, la sharika laka (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).” And the people repeated his words. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) approved of that. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) continued to recite the Talbiyah.’ Jabir said: ‘We did not intend (to do) anything but Hajj. We were not aware of ‘Umrah. Then when we reached the House with him, he touched the Corner, and walked quickly (Ramal) for three circuits and walked (normally) for four. Then he stood at the place of Ibrahim and said: “And take you (people) the place of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.” [2:125] He stood with the place between him and the House. My father used to say:* “And I do not think that he mentioned it other than from the Prophet (ﷺ): ‘That he used to recite in those two Rak’ah (at the place of Ibrahim): “Say: ‘O you disbelievers!’” [Al-Kafirun (109)] and “Say: ‘He is Allah, (the) One.’” [Al-Ikhlas (112)] “Then he went back to the House and touched the Corner, then he went out through the gate to Safa. When he drew near to Safa he recited: “Verily, Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah,” [2:158] (and said:) “We will start with that with which Allah started.” So he started with Safa and climbed it until he could see the House, then proclaimed the greatness of Allah (by saying: Allahu Akbar) and said Tahlil (La ilaha illallah) and praised Him (saying Al-Hamdulillah), and he said: “La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, yuhyi wa yumit wa huwa ‘ala kulli shai’in Qadir. La ilaha illallah wahdahu, La sharika lahu anjaza wa’dahu, wa nasara ‘abduhu, wa hazamal-Ahzaba wahdahu (None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the dominion, all praise is due to Him, He gives life and causes death and He is able to do all things. None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone; He has no partner or associate, He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave, and defeated the Confederates alone).” And he said that three times, supplication in between. Then he headed towards Marwah walking normally until, when he started to go downhill, he walked quickly (Ramal) in the bottom of the valley. When he started to go uphill, he walked normally, until he reached Marwah, and he did atop Marwah what he had done atop Safa. At the end of his Sa’y, atop Marwah he said: “If I had known before what I have come to know now, I would not have garlanded the sacrificial animal, and I would have made it ‘Umrah. Whoever among you does not have a sacrificial animal with him, let him exit Ihram and make it ‘Umrah.” So all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju’shum stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah! Is this for this year only, or forever and ever?” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) interlaced his fingers and said: “‘Umrah is included in Hajj like this,” twice. “No, it is forever and ever.” ‘Ali brought the camels of the Prophet (ﷺ), and he found that Fatimah was one of those who had exited Ihram. She had put on a dyed garment and used kohl. ‘Ali disliked this action on her part, but she said: “My father told me to do this.” ‘Ali used to say in Iraq: “So I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), feeling upset with Fatimah because of what she had done, to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about what she had said that he said, and that I had disliked that. He said: ‘She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth. What did you say when you began your Hajj?’” He said: “I said: ‘O Allah, I begin the Talbiyah for that for which your Messenger (ﷺ) begins the Talbiyah.’ (He said:) ‘And I have the sacrificial animal with me, so do not exit Ihram.’ He said: “The total number of sacrificial animals that ‘Ali had brought from Yemen and that the Prophet (ﷺ) brought from Al-Madinah were one hundred. Then all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, apart from the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. When the day of Tarwiyah came (the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah), they headed for Mina and began the Talbiyah for Hajj. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode. He prayed Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr at Mina. Then he stayed for a short while until the sun rose, and he ordered that a tent of goat hair be pitched for him in Namirah. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out, and the Quraish were certain that he was going to stay at Al-Mash’ar Haram or at Al-Muzdalifah, as Quraish used to do during the Ignorance days. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) continued until he came to ‘Arafat, where he found that the tent had been pitched for him in Namirah, and he stopped there. Then when the sun had passed its zenith, he called for Qaswa’ and she was saddled for him. He rode until he came to the bottom of the valley, and he addressed the people and said: ‘Your blood and your wealth are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Every matter of Ignorance days is abolished, beneath these two feet of mine. The blood feuds of the Ignorance days are abolished, and the first blood feud of Rabi’ah bin Harith, who was nursed among Banu Sa’d and killed by Hudhail. The usuries of Ignorance days are abolished, and the first usury (that I abolish) is our usury, the usury due to ‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib. It is all abolished. Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah, and intimacy with them has become permissible to you through Allah’s Word. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to sit on your bedding.** If they do that, then hit them, but in a manner that does not cause injury or leave a mark. Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them in a reasonable manner. I have left behind you something which, if you adhere to it, you will never go astray: the Book of Allah. You will be asked about me. What will you say?’ They said: ‘We bear witness that you have conveyed (the message) and fulfilled (your duty) and offered sincere advice.’ He gestured with his forefinger towards the sky and then towards the people, (and said:) ‘O Allah, bear witness, O Allah bear witness,’ three times. Then Bilal called the Adhan, then the Iqamah, and he prayed Zuhr. Then he made Iqamah and prayed ‘Asr, and he did not offer any prayer between them. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode until he came to the place of standing, and he made his she-camel face Sakharat*** with the path in the sand in front of him, and he faced the Qiblah, then he remained standing until the sun had set and the afterglow had lessened somewhat, when the disk of the sun disappeared. Then he seated Usamah bin Zaid behind him and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out. He pulled Qaswa’s reins tight until her head was touching the saddle, and he gestured with his right hand: ‘O people, calmly, calmly!’ Every time he came to a hill, he released the reins a little so that she could climb. Then he came to Muzdalifah where he prayed Maghrib and ‘Isha’ with one Adhan and two Iqamah, offering no prayer in between. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lay down until dawn came, and he prayed Fajr, when he saw that morning had come, with one Adhan and one Iqamah. Then he rode Qaswa’ until he came to Al-Mash’ar Al-Haram. He climbed it and praised Allah and proclaimed His greatness and that He is the only One worthy of worship. Then he remained standing until it had become quite bright, then he moved on before the sun rose. He seated Fadl bin ‘Abbas behind him, who was a man with lovely hair, white and handsome. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) moved on, he passed some women riding camels. Fadl started to look at them, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put his hand on the other side. Fadl turned his face to the other side to look. When he came to Muhassir, he sped up a little. Then he followed the middle road that brings you out to the biggest Pillar, until he reached the Pillar that is by the tree. He threw seven pebbles, saying the Takbir with each throw, pebbles suitable for Khadhf (i.e., the size of a chickpea) throwing from the bottom of the valley. Then he went to the place of slaughter, and slaughtered sixty-three camels with his own hand. Then he handed it over to ‘Ali who slaughtered the rest, and he gave him a share in his sacrificial animal. Then he ordered that a piece from each camel be brought; (the pieces) were put in a pot and cooked, and they (the Prophet (ﷺ) and ‘Ali) ate from the meat and drank from the soup. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) hastened to the House, and prayed Zuhr in Makkah. He came to Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib, who were providing water to the pilgrims at Zamzam, and said: ‘Draw me some water, O Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib. Were it not that the people would overwhelm you, I would have drawn water with you.’ So they drew up a bucket for him and he drank from it.’” * It appears that the speaker is Ja’far bin Muhammad who is narrating from his father, from Jabir. **And they say that the meaning if ‘your furniture’ or, ‘your special place’ in which case the objective is to say that the wife is not to admit anyone in the house whom the husband would be displeased with. ***Sakharat plural of Sakhrah rock or boulder.
