So we performed prayer, and we marked the location.* Later, when the sun reappeared, we realized that we had prayed facing a direction other than the Qiblah. We mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ), then the Words were revealed: ‘So wherever you turn there is the Face of Allah.’” [2:]","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":218}}}
