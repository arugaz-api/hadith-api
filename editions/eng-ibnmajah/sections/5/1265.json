He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up, then he prostrated for a long time, then he sat up, then he prostrated for a long time. He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he stood up, then he prostrated for a long time, then he sat up, then he prostrated for a long time. Then he finished and said: ‘Paradise was brought close to me, so that if I had dared, I could have brought you some of its fruits. And Hell was brought near to me, until I said: “O Lord, am I one of them?” Nafi’ said: “I think that he said: ‘And I saw a woman being scratched by a cat that belonged to her. I said: “What is wrong with this woman?” They said: “She detained it until it died of hunger; she did not feed it and she did not let it loose to eat of the vermin of the earth.”",
