If you told someone else to do it (that would be better).’ Then he fainted, then woke up and said: ‘Tell Bilal to call the Adhan, and tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. You are (like) the female companions of Yusuf.’ So Bilal was told to call the Adhan and he did so, and Abu Bakr was told to lead the people in prayer, and he did so. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) felt a little better, and he said: ‘Find me someone I can lean on.’ Barirah and another man came, and he leaned on them. When Abu Bakr saw him, he started to step back, but (the Prophet (ﷺ)) gestured him to stay where he was. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and sat beside Abu Bakr, until Abu Bakr finished praying. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed away.”",
