    "text": "It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud that a man did something with a woman that was less than adultery; I do not know how far it went, but it was less than adultery. He went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him about that. Then Allah revealed the words:“And perform the prayer, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful.” [11:114] He said: “O Messenger of Allah, is this only for me?” He said: “It is for everyone who acts upon it.”",
