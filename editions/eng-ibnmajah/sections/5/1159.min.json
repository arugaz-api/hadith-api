She said: ‘While the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was performing ablution for the Zuhr in my house and he had sent a Sa’i,* the Muhajirun gathered around him in large numbers, and he was busy dealing with them. When a knock on the door came, he went out and performed the Zuhr, then he sat and distributed what had been brought to him.’ She said: ‘He continued doing that until the ‘Asr. Then he came into my house and performed two Rak’ah. Then he said: “The matter of the Sa’i kept me from praying them after Zuhr, so I prayed them after ‘Asr.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Munkar"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Munkar"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":357}}}
