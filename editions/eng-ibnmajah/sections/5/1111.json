Abu Darda’ or Abu Dharr raised an eyebrow at me and said: ‘When was this Surah revealed? For I have not heard it before now.’ He (Ubayy) gestured to him that he should remain silent. When they finished, he said: ‘I asked you when this Surah was revealed and you did not answer me.” Ubayy said: ‘You have gained nothing from your prayer today except the idle talk that you engaged in.’ He went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him about that, and what Ubayy had said to him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Ubayy spoke the truth.’”",
