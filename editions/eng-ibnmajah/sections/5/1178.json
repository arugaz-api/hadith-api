Innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alaik, innahu la yudhillu man walait. Subhanaka rabbana tabarakta wa ta’alait (O Allah, pardon me along with those whom You have pardoned, be an ally to me along with those whom You are an ally to, guide me along with those whom You have guided, protect me from the evil that You have decreed, and bless for me that which You have bestowed. For verily You decree and none can decree over You. He whom You support can never be humiliated. Glory is to You, our Lord, You are Blessed and Exalted).”",
