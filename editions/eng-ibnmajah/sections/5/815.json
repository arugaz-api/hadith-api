    "text": "Ibn ‘Abdullah bin Mughaffal narrated from his father and he said:“I have rarely seen a man for whom innovation in Islam was harder to bear than him. He heard me reciting: ‘In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful’ Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Rahim [1:1] and he said: ‘O my son, beware of innovation, for I prayed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and with Abu Bakr, and with ‘Umar, and with ‘Uthman, and I never heard any of them saying this. When you (begin to) recite, say: ‘All the praises and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.’ (Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabbil-‘Alamin).’” [1:]",
