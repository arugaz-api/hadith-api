    "text": "It was narrated that Muhammad bin `Amr bin `Ata’ said, concerning Abu Humaid As-Sa`di:“I heard him when he was among ten of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), one of whom was Abu Qatadah bin Rib`i, saying: ‘I am the most knowledgeable of you about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When he stood up for prayer, he stood up straight and raised his hands until they were parallel to his shoulders, then he said: Allahu Akbar. When he wanted to bow in Ruku`, he raised his hands until they were parallel to his shoulders. When he said Sami` Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears those who praise Him), he raised his hands and stood up straight. When he stood up after two Rak`ah, he said Allahu Akbar and raised his hands until they were parallel to his shoulders, as he did when he started the prayer.’”",
