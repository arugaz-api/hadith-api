For twenty five, a Bint Makhad(a one year old she-camel), up to thirty-five; if there is no Bint Makhad, then a Bin Labun ( a two-year-old male camel). If there are more than thirty-five even one, then a Bint Labun ( a two-year-old she-camel) must be given up to forty-five. If there are more than forty-five, even one, then a Hiqqah (a three-year-old she-camel), up to sixty camels. If there are more than sixty, even one more, then a Jadha'ah ( a four-year-old she-camel) must be given, up to seventy-five. If there are more than seventy-five, even one more, then two Bint Labun must be given, upto ninety.
