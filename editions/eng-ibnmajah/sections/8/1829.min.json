We continued to do that until Mu'awiyah came to us in Al-Madinah. One of the things he said to the people was: 'I think that two Mudd wheat from Sham is equivalent to one Sa of this (i.e. dates).' So the people followed that.”Abu Sa'eed said: “I'll continue to pay it as I used to pay it at the time of Messenger of Allah for as long as I live.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Bukhari And Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":47}}}
