I would gather firewood for them when they stopped to camp and urge their camels along for them by singing when they rode. Praise is to Allah (SWT) who has caused His religion to prevail and has made Abu Hurairah an Imam.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":10}}}
