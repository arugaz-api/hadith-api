    "text": "It was narrated from Usaid bin Zuhair, the paternal nephew of Rafi' bin Khdij, that Rafi' bin Khadij said:“If one of us did not need his land, he would give it (to someone else to cultivate) in return for one third, or one half of the yield , and he would stipulate (that the should receive) the produce grows on the banks of three streams, and the grains that remain in the ear after threshing, and the produce irrigated by a stream. Life at that time was hard, and he would work (the land) with iron and whatever Allah (SWT) willed, and he would benefit from it. Then Rafi bin Khadij came to us and said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade you to do something that may seem beneficial to you, but obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger are more beneficial for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade Haq for you, and he said: “Whoever has no need of his land, let him give it to his brother (to cultivate) or let him leave it (uncultivated).”",
