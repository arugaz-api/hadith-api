He said: \"What did you mean by that?\" He said: \"One (divorce).\" He said: \"By Allah did you only mean one (divorce) thereby?\" He said: \"By Allah, I meant one.\" Then he sent her back to him. (Da'if)Muhammad bin Majah said: I heard Abul-Hasan ' Ali bin Muhammad Tanafisi saying: \"How noble is this Hadith.\" Ibn Majah said: 'Abu 'Ubaid left it (i.e., did not accept its narration) and Ahmad was fearful of it (i.e., of narrating it)",
