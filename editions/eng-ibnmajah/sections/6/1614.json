The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the funeral prayer for him and said: “Would that he had died somewhere other than his birthplace.” A man among the people said: “Why, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “If a man dies somewhere other than his birthplace, a space will be measured for him in Paradise (as big as the distance) from the place where he was born to the place where he died.”",
