Then he said: ‘O Messenger of Allah. Where is your father?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whenever you pass by the grave of an idolater, give him the tidings of Hell-fire.’ The Bedouin later became Muslim, and he said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave me a difficult task. I never passed the grave of an idolater but I gave him the tidings of Hell-fire.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":141}}}
