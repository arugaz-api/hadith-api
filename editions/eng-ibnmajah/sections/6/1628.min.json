{"author":"Sunan Ibn Majah","hadith":{"hadithnumber":1628,"arabicnumber":1628,"text":"It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“When they wanted to dig a grave for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), they sent for Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Jarrah, who used to dig graves in the manner of the people of Makkah, and they sent for Abu Talhah, who used to dig graves for the people of Al-Madinah, and he used to make a niche in the grave. They sent two messengers to both of them, and they said: ‘O Allah, choose what is best for Your Messenger.’ They found Abu Talhah and brought him, but they did not find Abu ‘Ubaidah. So he dug a grave with a niche for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When they had finished preparing him, on Tuesday, he was placed on his bed in his house. Then the people entered upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in groups and offered the funeral prayer for him, and when they finished the women entered, and when they finished the children entered, and no one led the people in offering the funeral prayer for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Muslims differed concerning the place where he should be buried. Some said that he should be buried in his mosque. Others said that he should be buried with his Companions. Then Abu Bakr said: ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “No Prophet ever passed away but he was buried where he died.” So they lifted up the bed of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on which he had died, and dug the grave for him, then he (ﷺ) was buried in the middle of Tuesday night. ‘Ali bin Abu Talib, Fadl bin ‘Abbas and his brother Qutham, and Shuqran the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went down in his grave. Aws bin Khawli, who was Abu Laila, said to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib: ‘I adjure you by Allah! Give us our share of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ So ‘Ali said to him: ‘Come down.’ Shuqran, his freed slave, had taken a Qatifah which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to wear. He buried it in his grave and said, ‘By Allah, no one will ever wear it after you.’ So it was buried with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":196}}}
