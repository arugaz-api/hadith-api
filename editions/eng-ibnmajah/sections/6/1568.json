I am not angry with Allah at all. Allah has bestowed all good on me.’ Then he passed by the graves of the Muslims and said: ‘They have caught up with a great deal of good.’ Then he passed by the graves of the idolaters and said: ‘They died before a great deal of good came to them.’ Then he turned and saw a man walking between the graves in his shoes and he said: ‘O you with the shoes, take them off.’” Muhammad bin Bashar narrated from Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi that he said: Abdullah bin Uthman used to say (about this hadith): \"A good hadith and a reliable narrator",
