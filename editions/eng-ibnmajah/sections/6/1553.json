    "text": "(It was narrated that Sa’eed bin Musayyab said:“I was present with Ibn ‘Umar at a funeral. When the body was placed in the niche-grave) he said, ‘Bismillah wa fi sabil-illah wa ‘ala millati rasul-illah’ (In the Name of Allah, for the sake of Allah and according to the religion of the Messenger of Allah). When he started to place bricks in the niche-grave he said: ‘Allahumma ajirha min ash-shaitani wa min ‘adhabil-qabr. Allahumma Jafil-arda ‘an janbaiha, wa sa’id ruhaha, wa laqqiha minka ridwana (O Allah, protect him from Satan and from the torment of the grave; O Allah, keep the earth away from his two sides and take his soul up and grant him pleasure from Yourself).’ I said: ‘O Ibn ‘Umar, is this something that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or is it your own words?’ He said: ‘I could have said something like that, but this is something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’”",
