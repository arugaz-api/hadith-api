He asked about it and they said: ‘(It is) so-and-so (a woman).’ He recognized the name and said: ‘Why did you not tell me about her?’ They said: ‘You were taking a nap and you were fasting, and we did not like to disturb you.’ He said: ‘Do not do that; I do not want to see it happen again that one of you dies, while I am still among you, and you do not tell me, for my prayer for him is a mercy.’ Then he went to the grave and we lined up in rows behind him, and he said four Takbir (i.e. for the funeral prayer).”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":96}}}
