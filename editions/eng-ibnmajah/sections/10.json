Then I went out, feeling happy with the ruling of Allah given upon the lips of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), until, when I was in the mosque, or, in one of the apartments, he called me and said: 'What did you say?' I told him the story, and he said: 'Stay in the house in which the news of your husband's death came to you, until your waiting period is ever.\"' She said: \"So I observed the waiting period there for four months and ten (days)",

I jumped on her and had intercourse with her. The next morning I went to my people and told them, and said to them: 'Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for me.' They said: 'We will not do that, lest Allah reveal Quran concerning us or the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) says, something about us, and it will be a lasting source of disgrace for us. Rather we will leave you to deal with it yourself. Go yourself and tell the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about your problem.' So I went out and when I came to him, I told him what happened. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Did you really do that?' I said: 'I really did that, and here I am, O Messenger of Allah. (ﷺ) I will bear Allah’s ruling on me with patience.' He said: 'Free a slave.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth, I do not own anything but myself.' He said: 'Fast for two consecutive months.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the thing that happened to me was only because of fasting.' He said: 'Then give charity, or feed sixty poor persons.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truttu we spent last night with no dinner.' He said: 'Then go to the collector of charity of Banu Zuraiq, and tell him to give you something, then feed sixty poor persons, and benefit from the rest",

Then 'Uwaimir met him ('Asim) and asked him about that, saying: 'What did you do?’ He said: I did that and you have not brought me any good. I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he disapproved of this question.’ Uwaimir said: 'By Allah, I will go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) myself and ask him.' So he went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and found that Qur'an had been revealed concerning them, and the Prophet (ﷺ) told them to go through the procedure of Li'an. 'Uwaimir said: 'O Messenger of Allah, (ﷺ) by Allah if I take her back, I would have been telling lies about her.' So he left her before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told him to do so, and that became the Sunnah for two who engage in the procedure of Li'an. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child who is black in color with widely-spaced dark eyes and large buttocks, then I think that he was telling the truth about her, but if she gives birth to a child with a red complexion like a Wahrah,[1] then I think that he was lying.' Then she gave birth to a child with features resembling those of the man concerning whom she was accused",

Hilal bin Umayyah stood up and bore witness, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will either of you repent?\" Then she stood up and affirmed her innocence. On the fifth time, meaning that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth, they said to her: \"It will invoke the wrath of Allah.\" Ibn 'Abbas said: \"She hesitated and backed up, until we thought that she was going to recant. Then she said: 'By Allah, I cannot dishonor my people for ever.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child with black eyes, fleshy buttocks and big calves, then he is the son of Sharik bin Sahma'.' And she gave birth to such a child.
