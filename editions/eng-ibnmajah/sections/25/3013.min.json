He (the narrator) said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) laughed,” or he said, “He smiled. Abu Bakr and ‘Umar said to him: ‘May my father and mother be ransomed for you, this is not a time when you usually laugh. What made you laugh, may Allah make your years filled with laughter?’ He said: ‘The enemy of Allah, Iblis, when he came to know that Allah answered my prayer and forgiven my nation, took some dust and started to sprinkle it on his head, uttering cries of woe and doom, and what I saw of his anguish made me laugh.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":132}}}
