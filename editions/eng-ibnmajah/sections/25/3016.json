He said:“I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have made my camel lean (because of the long journey) and I have worn myself out. By Allah, there is no sand hill on which I did not stand. Have I performed Hajj?’ The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever attended the prayer (i.e., Fajr at Muzdalifah) with us and departed from ‘Arafat, by night or day, may remove the dirt and has completed his Hajj.’”",
