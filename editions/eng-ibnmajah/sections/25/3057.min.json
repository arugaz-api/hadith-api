I will reach the Cistern (Hawd) before you, and I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations, so do not blacken my face (i.e., cause me to be ashamed). I will rescue some people, and some people will be taken away from me. I will say: “O Lord, my companions!” and He will say: “You do not know what innovations they introduced after you were gone.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":176}}}
