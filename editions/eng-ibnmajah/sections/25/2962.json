I said: ‘Why do you not seek refuge with Allah from the Fire?’ He said: ‘I seek refuge with Allah from the fire.’ Then he went and touched the Corner, then he stood between the (Black) Stone and the door (of the Ka’bah) and clung with his chest, hands and cheek against it. Then he said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do this.’”",
