By his head there is an angel who says Amin to his supplication, and every time he prays for his brother, he says: “Amin, and the same for you.’” He said: “Then I went out to the marketplace where I met Abu Darda’, and he told me something similar from the Prophet (ﷺ).”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":14}}}
