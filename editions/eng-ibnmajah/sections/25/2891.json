    "text": "It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) between Makkah and Al-Madinah, and we passed through a valley. He said: ‘What valley is this?’ They said: ‘Azraq Valley.’ He said: ‘It is as if I can see Musa (as) – and he mentioned something about the length of his hair, which Dawud (one of the narrators) did not remember – ‘putting his fingers in his ears and raising his voice to Allah reciting the Talbiyah, passing through this valley.’ Then we traveled on until we came to a narrow pass, and he said: ‘What pass is this?’ They said: ‘Thaniyyat Harsha’ or ‘Laft.’ He said: ‘It is as if I can see Yunus, on a red she-camel, wearing a woollen cloak and holding the reins of his she-camel, woven from palm fibres, passing through this valley, reciting the Talbiyah.’”",
