    "text": "It was narrated from 'Aishah bin Mas'ud bin Aswad, that her father said:“When the woman stole the Qatifah from the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we regarded that as a serious matter. She was a woman from Quraish. So we came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and spoke to him, and said: 'We will ransom her for forty Uqiyyah.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Purification is better for her.” When we heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) speak so kindly, we went to Usamah and said: 'Speak to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) .' When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that, he stood up to speak and said: 'How much do you intercede with me concerning one of the legal punishments of Allah (SWT) that has befallen one of the female slaves of Allah (SWT)! By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if Fatimah the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) were to do what she has done, Muhammad would cut off her hand.”",
