They said: ‘The daughter gets one half, and what is left goes to the sister. Go to Ibn Mas’ud, for he will concur with what we say.’ So the man went to Ibn Mas’ud, and told him what they had said. ‘Abdullah said: ‘I will go astray and will not be guided (if I say that I agree); but I will judge as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) judged. The daughter gets one half, and the son’s daughter gets one- sixth. That makes two thirds. And what is left goes to the sister.’”",

I heard him say: “What the son or father acquires goes to his. ‘Asabah, no matter who they are.’” So he ruled in our favour and wrote a document to that effect, in which was the testimony of ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf, Zaid bin Thabit and someone else. Then when ‘Abdul-Malik bin Marwan was appointed caliph, a freed slave of hers (Umm Wa’il’s) died, leaving behind two thousand Dinar. I heard that that ruling had been changed, so they referred the dispute to Hisham bin Isma’il. We referred the matter to ‘Abdul-Malik, and brought him the document of ‘Umar. He said: ‘I thought that this was a ruling concerning which there was no doubt. I never thought that the people of Al-Madinah would reach such a state that they would doubt this ruling.
