Jabir bin Abdullah asked him for respite but he refused. Jabir asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to intercede for him with him, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went and spoke to the Jew, asking him to accept dates in lieu of what was owed, but he refused. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spoke to him but he refused to give respite. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went in among the date-palm trees and walked among them. Then he said to Jabir: “Pick (dates) for him and pay off what is owed to him in full.” So he picked thirty Wasq of dates after the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came back, and there were twelve Wasq more (than what was owed). Jabir came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to tell him what had happened, and he found that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was absent. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came back he came to him and told him that he had paid off the debt in full, and he told him about the extra dates. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Tell 'Umar bin Khattab about that.” So Jabir went to 'Umar said to him: “I knew when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) walked amongst them that Allah (SWT) would bless them for us.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":45}}}
