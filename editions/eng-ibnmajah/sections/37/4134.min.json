When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw it, he said: ‘O Allah, bless it and bless the one who sent it.’” Nuqadah said: \"I said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): 'And for the one who brought it.' He said: 'And (bless) the one who brought it.' Then he ordered that it should be milked and it yielded plenty of milk.
