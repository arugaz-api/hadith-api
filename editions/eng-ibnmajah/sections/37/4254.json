    "text": "It was narrated from Ibn Mas’ud that a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said that he had kissed a woman, and he started to ask about expiation, but he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) did not say anything to him. Then Allah revealed the Verse:“And perform prayers at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful.” [11:114] The man said: “O Messenger of Allah, is this (the Verse) just for me?” He said: “It is for whoever acts upon it among my nation.”",
