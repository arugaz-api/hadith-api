    "text": "It was narrated from Abu Wa’il that a man from his people – Samurah bin Sahm – said:“We stopped with Abu Hashim bin ‘Utbah, who had been stabbed, and Mu’awiyah came to visit him. Abu Hashim wept and Mu’awiyah said to him: ‘Why are you weeping, O maternal uncle? Is there some pain bothering you, or is it because of this world, the best of which has already passed?’ He said: ‘It is not for any of these reasons. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave me some advice and I wish that I had followed it. He (ﷺ) said: “There may come a time when you will see wealth divided among the people, and all you will need of that is a servant and a mount to ride in the cause of Allah.” That time came, but I accumulated wealth.’”",
