While we were like that, they came and alighted. They came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Ashajj ‘Ansari was left behind. He came afterwards, and halted at the halting-place, made his she-camel kneel down, and changed of his traveling clothes, then he came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: ‘O Ashajj, you have two characteristics that Allah likes: Forbearance and deliberation.’ He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, was I born with them or are they acquired?’ He said: ‘No, rather it is something that you were born with.’”",
