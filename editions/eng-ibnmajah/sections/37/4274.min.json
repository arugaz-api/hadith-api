He said: ‘How dare you say this when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is among us?’ Mention of that was made to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he said: ‘Allah says: “And the trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown a second time, and behold they will be standing, looking on (waiting).” [39:68] I will be the first one to raise his head, and I will see Musa holding on to one of the pillars of the Throne, and I do not know whether he will have raised his head before me, or he will be one of those whom Allah exempts. And whoever says that I am better than Yunus bin Matta, he is lying.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":175}}}
