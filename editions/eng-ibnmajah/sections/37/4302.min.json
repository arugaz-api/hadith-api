By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I will drive men away from it as a man drives strange camels away from his cistern.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, will you recognize us?” He said: “Yes, you will come to me with radiant faces, hands and feet, because of the traces of ablution, and this is not for anyone but you.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":203}}}
