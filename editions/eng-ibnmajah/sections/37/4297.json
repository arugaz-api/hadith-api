    "text": "It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said:“We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on one of his campaigns. He passed by some people and said: ‘Who are these people?’ They said: ‘We are Muslims.’ There was a woman putting wood in her oven, and a son of hers was with her. When the flames got higher, she moved him away. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘Are you the Messenger of Allah?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘May my father and mother be ransomed for you. Is not Allah the Most Merciful of those who show mercy?’ He said: ‘Yes indeed.’ She said: ‘Is not Allah more Merciful than a mother to her child?’ He said: ‘Yes indeed.’ She said: ‘A mother would not throw her child into the fire.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lowered his head and wept. Then he looked up at her and said: ‘Allah does not punish any of His slaves except those who are defiant and rebellious, who rebel against Allah and refuse to say: La ilaha illallah.’”",
