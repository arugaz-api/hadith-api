    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Umamah Al Bahili said:\"The Messenger of Allah (saas) came out to us, leaning on a stick, and when we saw him we stood up. He said: 'Do not do what the Persians do for their leaders.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, why don't you pray to Allah for us?' He said: 'Allahummaghfirlana, warhamna, warda 'anna, wa taqabbal minna, wa adkhilnal-jannah, wa najjina minan-nar, wa aslih lana sha'nana kullah. [O Allah, forgive us and have mercy on us, be pleased with us and accept (our good deeds) from us, admit us to Paradise and save us from Hell, and rectify all our affairs].' It was as if we wanted him to say more, but he said: 'Have I not summed everything for you?",
