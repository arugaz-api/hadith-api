And the one who is sitting will be better than the one who is standing, and the one who is standing will be better than the one who is walking, and the one who is walking will be better than the one who is running. So break your bows, cut their strings and strike your swords against rocks, and if anyone enters upon anyone of you, let him be like the better of the two sons of Adam. (i.e. the one killed, not the killer).”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":36}}}
