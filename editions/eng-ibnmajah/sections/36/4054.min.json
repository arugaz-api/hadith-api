When you only see him with the wrath of Allah upon him, and hated by people, then honesty will be taken away from him, and when honesty is taken away from him, you will only see him as a traitor who is called such by others. When you only see him as a traitor who is called such by others, then mercy will be taken away from him, and when mercy is taken away from him, you will only see him as rejected and accursed, and when you only see him as rejected and accursed, then the bond of Islam will be taken away from him.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Mawdu"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Mawdu"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":129}}}
