{"author":"Sunan Ibn Majah","hadith":{"hadithnumber":4074,"arabicnumber":4074,"text":"It was narrated that Fatimah bint Qais said:\"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed one day, and ascended the pulpit, and he never used to ascend it, before that, except on Fridays. The people were alarmed by that, and some were standing and some were sitting. He gestured to them with his hand, telling them to sit. (Then he said:) 'By Allah, I am not standing here for something that will benefit you, an exhortation or warning. Rather Tamim Dari has come to me and told me something that prevented me from taking a rest because of the joy and delight (I felt), and I wanted to spread that joy among you. A cousin of Tamim Dari told me that the wind drove them to an island that they did not know, so they sat in the rowing boats of the ship and set out. There they saw something black, with long eyelashes. They said to it: \"What are you?\" It said: \"I am Jassasah,\" They said: \"Tell us.\" It said: \"I will not tell you anything or ask you anything. Rather there is this monastery that you have looked at. Go to it, for there is a man there who is longing to hear your news and tell you news.\" So they went there and entered upon him, and they saw an old man firmly shackled, with a sorrowful appearance and complaining a great deal. He said to them: \"Where have you come from?\" They said: \"From Sham.\" He said: \"How are the Arabs faring?\" They said: \"We are from among the Arabs. What do you want to ask about?\" He said: \"What has this man done who has appeared among you?\" They said: \"(He has done) well. He made enemies of some people, but Allah supported him against them and now they have become one, with one God and one religion.\" He said: \"What happened to the spring of Zughar?\" They said: \"It is good; we irrigate out crops from it and drink from it.\" He said: \"What happened to the date-palms between 'Amman and Baisan?\" They said: \"They bear fruit every year.\" He said: \"What happened to the Lake of Tiberias?\" They said: \"It overflows because of the abundance of water.\" He gave three deep sighs, then he said: \"If I were to free myself from these chains, I would not leave any land without entering it on these two feet of mine, except for Taibah, for I have no way to enter it.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'My joy is so great. This (Al-Madinah) is Taibah, and by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no narrow or broad road in it, or any plain or mountain, but there is an angel (standing) over it with his sword unsheathed, until the Day of Resurrection","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Matn"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih Matn"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":149}}}
