He said:“Why are you weeping?” He said: “I am weeping because of something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘A little showing off is polytheism and whoever shows enmity towards a friend of Allah has declared war on Allah. Allah loves those who se righteousness and piety are hidden, those who, if they are absent, are not missed, and if they are present, they are not invited or acknowledged. Their hearts are lamps of guidance and they get out of every trial and difficulty.’”",
