{"author":"Sunan Ibn Majah","hadith":{"hadithnumber":3956,"arabicnumber":3956,"text":"It was narrated that ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Abd Rabbil-Ka’bah said:“I came to ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin ‘As when he was sitting in the shade of the Ka’bah, and the people were gathered around him, and I heard him say: ‘While we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey, he stopped to camp and some of us were pitching tents, some were competing in shooting arrows and some were taking the animals out to graze them. Then his caller called out: “As-Salatu Jami’ah (prayer is about to begin).” So we gathered, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up and addressed us. He said: “There has never been a Prophet before me who was not obliged to tell his nation of what he knew was good for them, and to warn against what he knew was bad for them. With regard to this nation of yours, soundness (of religious commitment) and well-being has been placed in its earlier generations and the last of them will be afflicted with calamities and things that you dislike. Then there will come tribulations which will make the earlier ones pale into significance, and the believer will say: ‘This will be the end of me,’ then relief will come. Then (more) tribulations will come and the believer will say: ‘This will be the end of me,’ then relief will come. Whoever would like to be taken far away from Hell and admitted to Paradise, let him die believing in Allah and the Last Day, and let him treat people as he would like to be treated. Whoever gives his oath of allegiance to a ruler and gives a sincere promise, let him obey him as much as he can, and if another comes and challenges him, let them strike the neck (i.e., kill) the second one.’” He the narrator said: “I raised my head among the people and said: 'I adjure you by Allah, did you hear that from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?' He ('Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As) pointed with his hand to his ears and said: I heard it directly from him and memorized it.'”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":31}}}
