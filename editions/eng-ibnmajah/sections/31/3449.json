Ibn Abu ‘Atiq came to visit him and said to us: ‘You should use this black seed. Take five or seven (seeds) and grind them to a powder, then drop them into his nose with drops of olive oil, on this side and on this side. For ‘Aishah narrated to them that she heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “This black seed is a healing for every disease, except the Sam.” I said: “What is the Sam?” He said: “Death.”",
