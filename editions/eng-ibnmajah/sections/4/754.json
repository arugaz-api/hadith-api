Do you think you could come and perform prayer in my house in a place which I can then take as a place of prayer?' He said: 'I will do that.' The following day, the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr came, when the heat of the day had grown intense. He asked permission to enter, and I gave him permission. He did not sit down until he said: 'Where would you like me to perform prayer for you in your house?' I showed him the place where I wanted him to pray, so the Messenger of Allah stood and we lined up behind him, and he led us in praying two Rak'ah (units). Then I asked him to stay and eat some Khazirah that had been prepared for them",
