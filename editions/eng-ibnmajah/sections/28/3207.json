And we live in a land (where there is) game, so I hunt with my bow and with my trained dog and with my untrained dog.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘As for what you say about living in a land of the People of the Book, do not eat from their vessels unless you can find no alternative. If you can fidn no alternative then wash them and eat from them. With regard to what you say about hunting, whatever you catch with your bow, say the Name of Allah over it and eat. Whatever you catch with your trained dog, say the Name of Allah over it and eat. But whatever you catch with your untrained dog, then catch it, slaughter it, then eat.’”",
