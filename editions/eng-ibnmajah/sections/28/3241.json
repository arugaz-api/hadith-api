    "text": "It was narrated from Khalid bin Walid that a grilled mastigure was brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and placed near him. He stretched out his hand to eat (some of it), then those who were present said:“O Messenger of Allah, it is the flesh of a mastigure.” He took his hand away, and Khalid said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, is a mastigure unlawful?” He said: “No, but it is not found in my land and I find it distasteful.” He said: “Then Khalid bent over the mastigure and ate some of it, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was looking at him.”",
