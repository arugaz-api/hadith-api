Perhaps some of you may be more eloquent in presenting your case than others, so I rule in your favor because of what I hear from you. If I pass a judgement in favor of one of you that detracts from his brother's rights, then he should not take it, because it is a piece of fire that is given to him which he will bring forth on the Day Resurrection.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":10}}}
