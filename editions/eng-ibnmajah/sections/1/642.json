    "text": "It was narrated from 'Aishah that:Asma asked the Messenger of Allah about bathing after ones's period. He said: \"One of you should take her water and lote leaves, and purify herself well, or thoroughly. Then she should pour water over her head and rub it vigorously so that the water reaches the roots of her hair. Then she should take a piece of cotton perfumed with musk and purify herself with it.\" Asma said: \"How should I purify myself with it?\" He said: \"Subhan Allah! Purify yourself with it!\" 'Aishah said, as if whispering to her: \"Wipe away the traces of blood with it.\" Then she (Asma) asked him about bathing to cleanse oneself from sexual impurity. He said: \"One of you should take her water, and purify herself, and purify herself well, or thoroughly. She should pour water over her head and rub it so that the water reaches the roots of her hair, then she should pour water over her body.\" 'Aishah said: \"How good were the women of the Ansar! For they did not let shyness keep them from understanding their religion properly",
