I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘The lower wrap of the believer should come to mid-calf, but there is no sin on him if it comes between that point and the ankle. But whatever is lower than the ankle is in the Fire.’ And he said three times: ‘Allah will not look at the one who lets his lower wrap drag out of vanity.’”",
