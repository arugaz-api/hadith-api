The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Whoever among you wants to begin the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah, let him do so. If it were not for the fact that I have brought a sacrificial animal with me, I would have began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah.’” She said: “Some of the people began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah, and some began the Talbiyah for Hajj. I was one of those who began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah.” She said: “We set out until we reached Makkah, then the Day of ‘Arafah came while I was in menses, but I did not exit Ihram for ‘Umrah I complained about that to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: ‘Leave your ‘Umrah, undo your hair and comb it, and begin the Talbiyah for Hajj.’” She said: “So I did that, then on the night of Hasbah (i.e., the twelfth night of Dhul-Hijjah), when Allah had enables us to complete our Hajj, he sent ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr with me. He seated me behind him and went out to Tan’im, then I began the Talbiyah for ‘Umrah and Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj and ‘Umrah, and there was no sacrificial animal, charity nor fasting.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":25,"hadith":119}}}
