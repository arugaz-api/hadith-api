Tell me about the sickness of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ She said: ‘He felt pain and started to spit (over his body), and we began to compare his spittle to the spittle of a person eating raisins. Like a person eating raisins and spitting out the seeds. He used to go around among his wives, but when he became ill, he asked them permission to stay in the house of ‘Aishah and that they should come to him in turns.’ She said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon me, (supported) between two men, with his feet making lines along the ground. One of them was ‘Abbas.’ I told Ibn ‘Abbas this Hadith and he said: ‘Do you know who the other man was whom ‘Aishah did not name? He was ‘Ali bin Abu Talib.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Bukhari And Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":186}}}
