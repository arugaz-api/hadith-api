He said: “I bought land from you, but I did not buy the gold from you.” The man said: “Rather I sold you the land with whatever is in it.” They referred their case to (a third) man who said: “Do you have children?” One of them said: “I have a boy.” The other said: “I have a girl.” He said: “Marry the boy to the girl, and let them spend on themselves from it and give in charity.”",
