    "text": "It was narrated that Ibn Dhu’aib said:“A grandmother came to Abu Bakr Siddiq and asked him for her inheritance. Abu Bakr said to her: ‘You have nothing according to the Book of Allah, and I don’t know of anything for you according to the Book of Allah, and I don’t know of anything for you according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Go back until I ask the people.’ So he asked the people and Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah said: ‘I was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he gave her (the grandmother) one sixth.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘Is there anyone else with you (who will corroborate what you say)?’ Muhammad bin Maslamah Al-Ansari stood up and said something like what Mughirah bin Shu’bah had said. So Abu Bakr applied it in her case.”",
