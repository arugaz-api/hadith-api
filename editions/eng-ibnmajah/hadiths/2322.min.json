The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: 'Do you have proof' I said: 'No.’ He said to the Jews, 'Swear an oath.' I said: 'If he swears an oath he will take my property.' Then Allah, Glorious is He, revealed: 'Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter (Paradise). Neither will Allah neither speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purifies them, and they shall have a painful torment.'”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":15}}}
