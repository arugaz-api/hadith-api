    "text": "It was narrated from Jabir and Anas bin Malik that whenever the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) supplicated against the locusts, he said:“O Allah, destroy their large ones and kill their small ones, spoil their eggs and root them out. Take their mouths away from our livelihood and provision, for You are the One Who hears the prayers.” A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, are you praying against one of the troops of Allah, that they may be rooted out?” He said: “Locusts were sneezed out by the fish in the sea.”",
