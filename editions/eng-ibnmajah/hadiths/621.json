I am a woman who bleeds continuously and never becomes pure, should I give up the prayer?' He said: 'No, rather that is a vein and it is not menstruation. When the time of your period comes, leave off the prayer, and when it is over, take a bath and wash the blood from yourself and perform the prayer.\" This is the Hadith of Waki",
