    "text": "It was narrated that Abu ‘Umar said:“I heard Abu Juhaifah say: Good fortune was mentioned in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) while he was performing prayer. A man said: ‘so-and-so’s fortune is in horses.’ Another man said: ‘So-and-so’s fortune is in camels.’ Another man said: ‘So-and-so’s fortune is in sheep.’ Another man said: ‘So- and-so’s fortune is in slaves.’ While the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was finishing his prayer, he raised his head at the end of the last Rak’ah and said: ‘Allahumma Rabbana lakal-hamd mil’ as-samawati wa mil’ al- ard wa mil’ ma shi’ta min shai’in ba’du. Allahumma la mani’ lima a’taita wa la mu’ti lima mana’ta, wa la yanfa’u dhal-jaddi minkal-jadd (Allah hears those who praise Him. O Allah! O our Lord! To You is the praise as much as fills the heavens, as much as fills the earth and as much as You will after that. O Allah, there is none who can withhold what You give, and none who can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any fortunate person is to no avail against You).’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) elongated the word Jadd (fortune) so that they would know that it was not as they had said.”",
