Those who came before you were only destroyed because when one of their nobles stole, they let him off, but when one of the weak people among them stole, they would carry out the punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.” (Sahih)(One of the narrators) Muhammad bin Rumh said: “I heard Laith bin Sa'd say: 'Allah(SWT) protected her (Fatimah) from stealing, and every Muslim should say this.'”",
