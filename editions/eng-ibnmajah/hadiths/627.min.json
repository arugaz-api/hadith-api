She came to the Messenger of Allah and said: \"I am suffering prolonged and painful bleeding.\" He said: \"Fill it with a pad of cloth.\" She said: \"It is worse than that, it is flowing copiously.\" He said: \"Then bind yourself with a cloth and observe your menses for six or seven days, in the knowledge of Allah, then have a bath and perform prayer and fast for twenty-three or twenty-four days. Delay Zuhr and bring 'Asr forward, and take (one) bath for both, and delay Maghrib and bring 'Isha' forward, and have (one) bath for both.
