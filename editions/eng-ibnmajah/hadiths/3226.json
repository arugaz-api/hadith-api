He told him not to do that and said:“The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade throwing small pebbles and said: ‘They do not kill any game nor hurt the enemy, but they can break a tooth or put out an eye.’” He did it again, and he (‘Abdullah) said: “I tell you that the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade that and then you go and do it again? I will never speak to you again.”",
