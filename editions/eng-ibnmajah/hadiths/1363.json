    "text": "It was narrated from Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbas, that Ibn ‘Abbas told him that he slept at the house of Maimunah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), who was his maternal aunt. He said:“I lay down across the pillow and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife were laying along it. The Prophet (ﷺ) slept until midnight, or a little before, or a little after. The Prophet (ﷺ) woke up and began to rub the sleep from his face with his hand. Then he recited the last ten Verses of Surah Al ‘Imran. Then he got up and went to a water skin that was hanging up and performed ablution from it, and he performed ablution well, then he stood up and prayed.” ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas said: “I stood up and did what he had done, then I went and stood beside him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put his right hand on my head, took hold of my right ear and tweaked it. Then he prayed two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then he prayed Witr. Then he lay down until the Mu’adh-dhin came to him and he prayed two brief Rak’ah, then he went out to pray.”",
