The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sat, with ‘Aishah by his side, and I was sitting beside Abu Bakr. Our mount* and the mount of Abu Bakr was one, under the care of the slave of Abu Bakr. The slave looked and his camel was not with him, so he said to him: ‘Where is your camel?’ He said: ‘I lost it yesterday.’ He said: ‘You have one camel with you and you lost it?’ He started to beat him, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Look at what this Muhrim is doing!’”",
