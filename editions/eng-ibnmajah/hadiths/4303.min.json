When I came to him, he said: ‘We have caused you some trouble O Abu Sallam.’ He said: ‘Yes, by Allah, O Commander of the Believers!’ He said: ‘By Allah, we did not want to cause you any hardship, but there is a Hadith which I have heard that you narrate from Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), concerning the Cistern, and I wanted to hear it directly from you.’ He said: “I said: ‘Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), told me that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “My Cistern is (wider than) the distance between Ailah and ‘Aden. It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, and its cups are as many as the stars in the sky. Whoever drinks from it will never feel thirst again. The first ones who come to drink from it will be the poor Muhajirin, with dirty clothes and disheveled hair, who do not marry refined women and for whom no doors are opened.” ‘Umar wept until his beard became wet, then he said: ‘But I have married refined women and doors have been opened for me. Certainly I will not wash the clothes that are on my body until they become dirt, and I will not comb my hair until it becomes disheveled.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":204}}}
