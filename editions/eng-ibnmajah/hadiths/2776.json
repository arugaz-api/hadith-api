    "text": "It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that his maternal aunt Umm Harim bint Milhan said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slept near me one day, then he woke up smiling. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what has made you smile?’ He said: ‘People of my nation who were shown to me (in my dream) riding across this sea like kings on thrones.’ I said: ‘Supplicate to Allah to make me one of them.’” So he prayed for her. Then he slept again, and did likewise, and she said the same as she said before, and he replied in the same manner. She said: “Pray to Allah to make me one of them,” and he said: “You will be one of the first ones.” He said: “Then she went out with her husband, ‘Ubadah bin Samit, as a fighter, the first time that the Muslims crossed the sea with Mu’awiyah bin Abu Sufyan. On their way back, after they had finished fighting, they stopped in Sham. An animal was brought near for her to ride it, but it threw her off, and she died.”",
