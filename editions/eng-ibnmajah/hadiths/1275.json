    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said:“Marwan brought the pulpit out one ‘Eid day and started to deliver the sermon before the prayer. A man stood up and said: ‘O Commander of the Believers, you have gone against the Sunnah. You have brought the pulpit out on the day of ‘Eid and it was not brought out before, and you started with the sermon before the prayer, when this was not done before.’ Abu Sa’eed said: ‘As for this man, he has done his duty. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, and he is able to change it with his hand, then change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, (do so) with his tongue then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.”",
