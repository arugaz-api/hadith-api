Then he took something from the camel, and extracted from it a hair, which he placed between two of his fingers. Then he said: ‘O people, this is part of your spoils of war. Hand over a needle and thread and anything greater than that or less than that. For stealing from the spoils of war will be a source of shame for those who do it, and ignominy and Fire, on the Day of Resurrection.’”",
