Then he said: ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Whoever puts on a new garment and says: Al-hamdu lillahil- ladhi kasani ma uwari bihi ‘awrati, wa atajammalu bihi fi hayati (Praise be to Allah Who has clothed me in something with which I conceal my nakedness and adorn myself in my life), then takes the garment that has worn out, or that he had taken off and gives it in charity, he will be under the shelter, protection and care of Allah, whether he lives or dies.’ He said this three times.”",
