    "text": "It was narrated from Abu Musa that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“In a dream I saw myself emigrating from Makkah to a land in which there were date-palm trees, and I thought that it was Yamamah or Hajar, but it was Al-Madinah, Yathrib. And I saw in this dream of mine that I was wielding a sword then it broke in the middle. That was what befell the believers on the Day of Uhud. Then I wielded it again and it was better than it had been before, and that is what Allah brought about of the Conquest and the regrouping of the believers. And I also saw cows, and by Allah it is good, for they are the group of the believers (who were martyred) on the Day of Uhud, and the goodness is that which Allah brought forth after that, and the reward of the truth which Allah brought us on the Day of Badr.”",
