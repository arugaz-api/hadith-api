    "text": "It was narrated from Ayas bin Salamah bin Akwa’ that his father said:“We attacked, Hawazin at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with Aby Bakr. He awarded me a slave girl from Banu Fazarah, among the most beautiful of the Arabs, who was wearing an animal skin of hers. I did not divest her of her clothing until I reached Al-Madinah. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) met me in the marketplace, and said: ‘By Alla, give her to me.’ So I gave her to him, and he sent her as a ransom for some of the Muslim prisoners who were in Makkah.”",
