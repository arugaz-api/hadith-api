    "text": "It was narrated that a man from Banu Suwa'ah said:'I said to 'Aishah: Tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' She said: 'Have you not read the Qur'an: “And verily, you (O Mohammed {SAW}) are on an exalted (standard of) character?” She said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was with his Companions, and I made some food for him, and Hafsah made some food for him, but Hafash got there before me. So I said to the slave girl: “Overturn her bowl.” She went and caught up with her, and she was about to put (the bowl) in front of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). She overturned it and the bowl broke, scattering the food. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gathered the pieces and the food on the leather mat and they ate. Then he sent for my bowl and gave it to Hafsah, and said: “Take this pot in place of your pot, and eat what is in it.” And I did not see any expression of anger on the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' ”",
