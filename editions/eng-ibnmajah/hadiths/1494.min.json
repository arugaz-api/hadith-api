Is this how you saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) standing in relation to the body of a man and a woman as you have stood?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ Then he turned to us and said: ‘Remember this.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":62}}}
