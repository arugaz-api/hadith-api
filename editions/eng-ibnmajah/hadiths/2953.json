    "text": "It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said:“During his ‘Umrah after Hudaibiyah – when they wanted to enter Makkah – the Prophet (ﷺ) said to his Companions: ‘Your people will see you tomorrow, so let them see you looking strong.’ When they entered the mosque, they touched the corner and started to walk briskly, and the Prophet (ﷺ) was with them. When they reached the Yemenite Corner, they walked normally to the Black Corner (the corner where the Black Stone is), then they walked briskly until they reached the Yemenite Corner, then they walked normally to the Black Corner. They did that three times, then they walked normally for four circuits.”",
