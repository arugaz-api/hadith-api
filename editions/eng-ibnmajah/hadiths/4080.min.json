(This will continue) until, when their time has come, and Allah wants to send them against the people, they will dig until they can almost see the rays of the sun, then the one who is in charge of them will say: \"Go back, and we will dig it tomorrow if Allah wills.' So they will say: \"If Allah wills.\" Then they will come back to it and it will be as they left it. So they will dig and will come out to the people, and they will drink all the water. The people will fortify themselves against them in their fortresses. They will shoot their arrows towards the sky and they will come back with blood on them, and they will say: \"We have defeated the people of earth and dominated the people of heaven.\" Then Allah will send a worm in the napes of their necks and will kill them thereby.'\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the beasts of the earth will grow fat on their flesh","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":155}}}
