    "text": "It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“As for the people of Hell, who are its people (i.e., its permanent residents), they will neither die nor live therein. But there are some people who will be punished with fire because of their sins, whom it will kill, then when they have become like coal, permission will be granted for intercession for them. They will be brought, group by group, and scattered on the banks of the rivers of Paradise. It will be said: ‘O people of Paradise, pour water on them.’ Then they will grow like seeds carried by a flood (i.e., quickly).” A man among the people said: It is as if the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has been in the desert.”",
