So he went and we went with him, to the shelter, where he milked a sheep for him and (mixed it with) the water that had been kept overnight in a water skin. He drank from it, then he did likewise for his Companion who was with him.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":30,"hadith":62}}}
