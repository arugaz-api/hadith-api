I heard that from him for a while, then I said to myself: ‘By Allah! What is this weakness? Every time he heard the Adhan for Friday (prayer) I hear him praying for forgiveness for Abu Umamah and supplicate for him, and I do not ask him about why he does that.’ Then I took him out for Friday (prayer), as I used to take him out, and when he heard the Adhan he prayed for forgiveness as he used to do. I said to him: ‘O my father! I see you supplicating for As’ad bin Zurarah every time you hear the call for Friday; why is that?’ He said: ‘O my son, he was the first one who led us for the Friday prayer before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came from Makkah, in Naqi’ Al- Khadamat (a place near Al-Madinah), in the plain of Harrah Banu Bayadah.’ I asked: ‘How many of you were there at that time?’ He said: ‘Forty men.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":280}}}
