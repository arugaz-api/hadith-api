I found him with my sister Zainab and said: 'o Messenger of Allah! I need to ask you something.' He said: 'What is it?' I said: 'I bleed continuously and heavily, and that is keeping me from prayer and fasting. What do you command me to do about it?' He said: 'I advise you to use a piece of cotton, for that will take away the blood.' I said: 'It is more than that.'\" And he mentioned something like the Hadith of Sharik (below)",
