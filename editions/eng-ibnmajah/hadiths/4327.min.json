It will be said: “O people of Paradise!” And they will look. Anxious and afraid lest they be brought out of the place they are in. Then it will be said: “O people of Hell!” and they will look, hoping that they will be brought out of the place they are in. Then it will be said: “Do you know what this is?” They will say: “Yes, this is Death.” Then the command will be given for it to be slaughtered on the Sirat, and it will be said to both groups: “It is eternal wherever you are, and there will never be any death therein.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":228}}}
