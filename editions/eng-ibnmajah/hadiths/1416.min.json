So they came to Sahl bin Sa’d and asked him. He said: ‘There is no one left who knows more about that than I. It is made of tamarisk (a type of tree) from Ghabah. It was made by so-and-so, the freed slave of so- and-so (a woman), (who was) a carpenter. He brought it and he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) stood on it when it was put in position. He faced the Qiblah and the people stood behind him. He recited Qur’an, then bowed and raised his head, then he moved backwards until he prostrated on the ground, then he went back to the pulpit and recited Qur’an, then bowed and raised his head, then he moved backwards until he prostrated on the ground.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Bukhari And Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":614}}}
