    "text": "It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:“When Friday comes, angels stand at every door of the mosque and record the names of the people who come, in order of arrival. When the Imam comes out, they close their records and listen to the sermon. The first one who comes to the prayer is like one who sacrifices a camel; the one who comes after him is like one who sacrifices a cow; the one who comes after him is like one who sacrifices a ram,” (and so on) until he made mention of a hen and an egg. Sahl added in his Hadith: “And whoever comes after that comes only to do his duty with regard to the prayer.”",
