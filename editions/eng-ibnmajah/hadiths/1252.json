    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“Safwan bin Mu’attal asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): ‘O Messenger of Allah, I want to ask you about something of which you have knowledge and I know nothing.’ He said: ‘What is it?’ He said: ‘Is there any time of the night or day when it is disliked to perform prayer? He said: ‘Yes, when you have prayed the Subh, then do not pray until the sun has risen, for it rises between the two horns of Satan. Then pray, for the prayer is attended (by the angels) and is acceptable (to Allah) until the sun is right overhead like a spear. For at that time Hell is heated up and its gates are opened. (Then refrain from prayer) until the sun passes the zenith. Then when it has passed the zenith, the prayer is attended (by the angels) and is acceptable (to Allah) until you pray the ‘Asr. Then stop praying until the sun has set.’”",
