He said: I performed Tawaf with Anas bin Malik in the rain. When we finished the Tawaf, we came behind the Maqam and prayed two Rak’ah.’ Anas said to us: ‘Start your deeds anew, for you have been forgiven. This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us when we performed Tawaf with him in the rain.’”",
