The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'I do not think you stole them.’ He said: 'Yes I did.' Then he said (again): ‘I do not think that you stole them.’ and he said: 'Yes I did.' Then he ordered that his hand be cut off. The Prophet (ﷺ) ' Say: I seek Allah's forgiveness and I repent to Him.' So he (the thief) said: 'I seek Allah's forgiveness and I repent to him.' He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said twice: 'O Allah! Accept his repentance.”",
