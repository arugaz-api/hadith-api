    "text": "It was narrated from ‘Amr bin ‘Awf, who was an ally of Banu ‘Amir bin Lu’ai and was present at (the battle of) Badr with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent ‘Ubaidah bin Jarrah to Bahrain to collect the Jizyah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) had made a treaty with the people of Bahrain, and he appointed as their governor ‘Ala’ bin Hadrami. Abu ‘Ubaidan came with the wealth from Bahrain and the Ansar heard that Abu ‘Ubaidah had come, so they attended the Fajr prayer with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had prayed, he went away, so they intercepted him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled when he saw them, then he said:‘I think you have heard that Abu ‘Ubaidah has brought something from Bahrain?’ They said: ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Be of good cheer and hope for that which will make you happy. By Allah, I do not fear poverty for you, rather I fear that you will enjoy ease and plenty like those who came before you, and that you will compete with one another as they did, and you will be destroyed as they were.’”",
