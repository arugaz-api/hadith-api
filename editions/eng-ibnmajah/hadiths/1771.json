He wanted to spend the last ten days of Ramadan in I’tikaf, so he ordered that a tent be set up for him.” Then ‘Aishah ordered that a tent be set up for her, and Hafash ordered that a tent be set up for her. When Zainab saw their two tents, she also ordered that a tent be set up for her. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that, he said: “It is righteousness that you seek?” Then he did not observe I’tikaf during Ramadan, and he observed I’tikaf during ten days of Shawwal",
