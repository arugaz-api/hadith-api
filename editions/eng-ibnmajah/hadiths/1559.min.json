The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Be gentle with him, may Allah be gentle with him, for he loved Allah and His Messenger.’ Then his grave was dug and he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) said: ‘Make it spacious for him, and may Allah make it spacious for him.’ Some of his Companions said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you are grieving for him.’ He said: ‘Yes indeed, for he loved Allah and His Messenger.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":127}}}
