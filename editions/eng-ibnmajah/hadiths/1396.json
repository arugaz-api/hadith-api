    "text": "It was narrated from ‘Asim bin Sufyan Thaqafi that they went on the campaign of Salasil, but no battle took place; they only took up their positions. Then they came back to Mu’awiyah, and Abu Ayyub and ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir were with him. ‘Asim said:“O Abu Ayyub, we have missed out on Jihad this year, and we were told that whoever prays in the four mosques will be forgiven his sins.” He said: “O son of my brother, shall I not tell you of something easier than that? I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: ‘Whoever performs ablution as he has been commanded, and prays as he has been commanded, will be forgiven his previous (bad) deeds.’” He said: “(Did he not say it) like that, O ‘Uqbah?” He said: “Yes.”",
