    "text": "It was narrated that Anas said:“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by a dome-shaped structure at the door of a man among the Ansar and said: ‘What is this? ‘They said: ‘A dome that was built by so-and-so.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘All wealth that is like this (extravagant) will bring evil consequences to its owner on the Day of Resurrection.’ News of that reached the Ansari, so he demolished it. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by (that place) later on and did not see it. He asked about it and was told that its owner had demolished it because of what he had heard from him. He said: ‘May Allah have mercy on him, may Allah have mercy on him.’”",
