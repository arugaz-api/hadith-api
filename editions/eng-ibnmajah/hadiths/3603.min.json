He turned to me, and I was wearing a thin cloak dyed with safflower, and said: ‘What is this?’ And I realized that he disliked it. I came to my family when they were heating their oven and threw it (in the oven). Then I came to him the following day and he said: ‘O ‘Abdullah, what happened to the thin cloak?’ I told him (what I had done) and he said: ‘Why did you not give it to some of your family to wear, for there is nothing wrong with it for women.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":54}}}
