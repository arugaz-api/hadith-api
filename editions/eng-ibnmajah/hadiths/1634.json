    "text": "It was narrated that Umm Salamah bint Abi Umayyah, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ), said:“At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), if a person stood to pray, his gaze would not go beyond his feet. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, if a person stood to pray, his gaze would not go beyond the place where he put his forehead when prostrating. Then Abu Bakr died and it was ‘Umar (the caliph). So, when any person stood to pray his gaze would not go beyond the Qiblah. Then came the time of ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan, and there was Fitnah (tribulation, turmoil), and the people started to look right and left.”",
