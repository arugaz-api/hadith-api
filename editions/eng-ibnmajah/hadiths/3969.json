And one of you may speak a word that angers Allah, and not know how far it reaches, but Allah will record against him his anger, until the Day he meets Him due to that word.” 'Alqamah said: \"So look, woe to you, at what you say and what you speak about, for there is something that I wanted to say but I refrained because of what I heard from Bilal bin Harith",
