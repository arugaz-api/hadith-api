    "text": "It was narrated that Anas said:“Umm Sulaim sent with me a basket of fresh dates for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but I did not find him, as he had just gone out to a freed slave of his who had invited him and made food for him. I came to him and he was eating, and he called me to eat with him. He (the freed slave) had served him Tharid with meat and gourd, and he liked the gourd, so I started to collect the (pieces of) gourd and put them near him. When he had eaten he went back to him house and I put the basket (of dates) before him, and he started to eat them and share them, until he finished the last of them.”",
