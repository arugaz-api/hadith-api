Sa'd bin 'Ubadah referred his case to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), who said: 'Give him one hundred lashes.' They said: 'O Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah (ﷺ), he is too weak to bear that. If we give him one hundred lashes he will die.' He said: “Then take a branch with a hundred twigs and hit him once.” Another chain reports a similar hadith",
