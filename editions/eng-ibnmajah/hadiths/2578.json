    "text": "Anas bin Malik narrated that :some people from (the tribe of) `Urainah came to us (to Al-Madinah) during the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but they did not want to stay in Al-Madinah because the climate did not suit them. He said: “Go out to the camels which belong to us, and drink their milk and urine.” So they did that (and recovered), then they apostatized from Islam and killed the herdsman of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and stole his camels. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent people after them, and they were brought back. Then he cut off their hands and feet, branded their eyes and left them in Harrah until they died",
