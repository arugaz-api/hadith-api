    "text": "It was narrated that Salamah bin Muhabbiq said:“When the Verse of legal punishments was revealed, it was said to Abu Thabit Sa'd bin Ubadah, who was a jealous man: ‘If you found another man with your wife, what would you do?’ He said: “I would strike them both wife the sword; do you think I should wait until I bring four (witness) and he has satisfied himself and gone away? Or should I say I saw such and such, and you will carry out the legal punishment punishment on me (for slander) and never accept my testimony thereafter?' Mention of that was made to the prophet (ﷺ) and he said: “The sword is sufficient as a witness.' Then he said: 'No (on second thought) I am afraid that the drunkard and the jealous would pursue that.” (Da'if) Abu Abdullah - meaning Ibn Majah - said: “I heard Abu Zurah saying: “This is a Hadith of Ali bin Muhammad At-Tanafisi, I did not hear it from him.”",
