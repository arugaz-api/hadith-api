Those who have property and wealth have surpassed us in reward. They say the same as we do, and they spend but we do not spend.’ He said to me: ‘Shall I not tell you something which, if you do it, you will catch up with those who have surpassed you and you will excel over those who come after you? Praise Allah (by saying Al- Hamdu Lillah) after every prayer, and glorify Him (by saying Subhan- Allah) and extol Him (by saying Allahu Akbar), thirty-three, thirty- three, and thirty-four times.’” Sufyan said: “I do not know which of them was to be recited thirty-four times.”",
