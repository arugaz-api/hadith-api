Whoever leaves behind poor dependents and a debt, it is for us to take care of – or he said: ‘It is for Allah and His Messenger (to take care of) – I am the heir of the one who has no heir, I will pay the blood money on his behalf and inherit from him. And the maternal uncle is the heir of the one who has no heir, he pays blood money on his behalf and inherits from him.”",
