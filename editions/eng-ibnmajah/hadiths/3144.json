    "text": "Sulaiman bin ‘Abdur-Rahman said:“I heard ‘Ubaid bin Fairuz say: ‘I said to Bara’ bin ‘Azib: “Tell us of the sacrificial animals that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) disliked or forbade.” He said: “Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said like this with his hand. And my hand is shorter than his hand:* ‘There are four that will not be accepted as sacrifices: The one-eyed animal that is obviously blind in one eye; the sick animal that is obviously sick; the lame animal with an obvious limp; and the animal that is so emaciated that it is as if there is no marrow in its bones.’” He said:** “And I dislike that the animal should have some fault in its ears.” He said: “What you dislike, forget about it and do not make it forbidden to anyone.”",
