    "text": "It was narrated that ‘Aishah said:“When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, they differed as to whether his grave should have a niche or a ditch in the ground, until they spoke and raised their voices concerning that. Then ‘Umar said: ‘Do not shout in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), living or dead,’ or words to that effect. So they sent for both the one who made a niche and the one who dug graves without a niche, and the one who used to make a niche came and dug a grave with a niche for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), then he (ﷺ) was buried.”",
