I recited (an Ayah of) prostration and prostrated, and the tree prostrated when I did, and I heard it saying: Allahummah-tut anni biha wizran, waktub li biha ajran, waj’al-ha li ‘indaka dhukhran (O Allah, reduce my burden of sin thereby, reward me for it and store it for me with You).’ Ibn ‘Abbas said: “I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) recite (an Ayah of) prostration and then prostrate, and I heard him saying in his prostration something like that which the man had told him the tree said.”",
