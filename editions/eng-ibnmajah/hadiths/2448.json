    "text": "It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:“A man from among the Ansar Came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why do I see that your color has changed?' He said: 'Hunger.' So the Ansari went to his dwelling, but he did not find anything in his dwelling, so he went out looking, and he found a Jew watering his date-palm trees. The Ansari stipulated that he would not take any dates that were black (rotten), hard and dried out or inferior, and he would only take good quality dates. He earned nearly two Sa's (of dates), and he brought it to the Prophet (ﷺ).”",
