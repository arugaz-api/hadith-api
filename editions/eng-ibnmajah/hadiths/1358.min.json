He would prostrate for as long as it takes anyone of you to recite fifty Verses before he would raise his head. When the Mu’adh-dhin fell silent after the first Adhan for the Subh prayer, he would get up and pray two brief Rak’ah.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":556}}}
